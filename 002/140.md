# Lack of Input Validation on Deposited Amounts

## Summary
The `LidoVault` contract does not impose an upper limit on the amount a single user can deposit into either the fixed or variable sides. While it ensures that deposits do not exceed the remaining capacity, the absence of a per-user deposit cap allows a single user to dominate a side, restricting participation from others and centralizing risk and rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `deposit` function, the contract verifies that the deposited amount does not exceed the remaining capacity but does not enforce a maximum deposit per user:

    function deposit(uint256 side) external payable {
        // ...
        require(msg.value >= minimumDepositAmount, "MDA");
        // ...
    }

The contract only checks that the deposit amount does not surpass the remaining capacity of the fixed or variable side. But a single user can deposit a disproportionately large amount, potentially filling the entire capacity of one side.

Without a per-user deposit cap, a user can contribute significantly more than others. This limits participation from other users, centralizes risk and rewards.

## Impact
A single user dominating a deposit side can lead to centralized risk and restricts other users from participating.

## Recommendation
Implement a maximum deposit limit per user to prevent any single address from dominating the fixed or variable sides. A `maxDepositPerUser` variable could be used and enforced within the `deposit` function.
