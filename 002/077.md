# There will be cases where the last user needs to deposit much more than the minimum amount

## Summary

In order for the vault to start, the capacity must be filled at 100%. The minimum that a user can deposit is 5% so there are maximum of <= 20 users per vault, this is important because if there are much more users the other functions might not work because there are a lot of for loops which will cause transactions to be OOG. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem occurs because of the minimum deposit of 5%. It is made in such way that when you deposit there is a variable that checks how much there is left and if the remaining amount is less than 5% your transaction will revert. Basically you can't deposit 96% because this will break the minimum amount of 5% and the last user can't deposit 4%. The problem is that sometimes an edge case will occur where the vault is filled at 91%. Which means that the last user will have to deposit 9%, because if he deposits 5% his transaciton will revert because the remaining will be 4% and he also can't deposit 4% because it is less than the minimum

Let's examine this problem using the `FIXED` side

```solidity

 function deposit(uint256 side) external payable {
    // fixedSideCapacity will not be zero of initialized
    require(fixedSideCapacity != 0, "NI");
    
    require(!isStarted(), "DAS");
    require(side == FIXED || side == VARIABLE, "IS");
   
    require(msg.value >= minimumDepositAmount, "MDA");

    uint256 amount = msg.value;
    if (side == FIXED) {
      // Fixed side deposits

      uint256 minimumFixedDeposit = fixedSideCapacity.mulDiv(minimumFixedDepositBps, 10_000);
>>    require(amount >= minimumFixedDeposit, "MFD");

      // no refunds allowed
      require(amount <= fixedSideCapacity - fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply, "OED");
      // do not allow remaining capacity to be less than minimum fixed deposit bps
>>    uint256 remainingCapacity = fixedSideCapacity - fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply - amount;
>>    require(remainingCapacity == 0 || remainingCapacity >= minimumFixedDeposit, "RC");

      // Stake on Lido
      /// returns stETH, and returns amount of Lido shares issued for the staked ETH
      uint256 stETHBalanceBefore = stakingBalance();
     
      uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
      require(shares > 0, "ISS");
      // stETH transfered from Lido != ETH deposited to Lido - some rounding error
      uint256 stETHReceived = (stakingBalance() - stETHBalanceBefore);
      
      require((stETHReceived >= amount) || (amount - stETHReceived <= LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH), "ULD");
      emit FundsStaked(amount, shares, msg.sender);

      // Mint claim tokens
     
      fixedClaimToken[msg.sender] += shares;
      fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply += shares;
      fixedETHDepositToken[msg.sender] += amount;
      fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply += amount;

      emit FixedFundsDeposited(amount, shares, msg.sender);
    }

 }
```

As we can see the first require stops us from depositing less than the minimum, while the second one checks if the remaining amount is less than the minimum, this means that the scenario will occur. Once the collected amount is between 90% and 95% the last user will have to pay the whole remaining amount in order to participate in the vault, otherwise he will not be able to


## Impact

Impact is medium because certain users will not be able to join the vault by paying the minimum amount. They will have to pay more in order to join, yes they will earn more yield than the others but this is not the case, the same rules have to be applied for every user so it is fair for everyone

Likelihood is medium because each user will make different deposits, some will deposit the minimum of 5% while the others will pay more, but the case that I explained can be easily hit.

## Recommendation

In the current business logic it will be hard to mitigate this. Maybe instead of strict checks for the capacity, you can add like 5% more to it so the amount collected can be between 100% and 105%. Once it hits 100% or over the vault needs to start.
