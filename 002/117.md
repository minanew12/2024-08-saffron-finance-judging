# Fixed-Side Capacity Calculation Error Leading to Unnecessary Deposit Rejections

## Summary
A bug in the `remainingCapacity` calculation for the `fixedside` of the vault in `deposit` function leads to deposits being rejected unnecessarily when the remaining capacity is smaller than the `minimumFixedDeposit`. This could block further deposits and prevent the vault from reaching full capacity, thereby delaying or stopping operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs when the remaining capacity on the fixed side of the vault is less than the `minimumFixedDeposit`, but greater than zero. According to the current logic, deposits are allowed only if the remaining capacity is either zero or larger than the `minimumFixedDeposit`. This means that if a small deposit would fill the vault to its capacity, but the remaining capacity is below the `minimumFixedDeposit`, the deposit is rejected, which blocks further deposits. 

Example:  
- Vault capacity: 10 ETH  
- Current deposits: 9.01 ETH  
- Remaining capacity: 0.99 ETH  
- `minimumFixedDeposit`: 0.5 ETH (5% of 10 ETH)  

Since the remaining capacity (0.99 ETH) is greater than zero but less than the `minimumFixedDeposit` (0.5 ETH), the logic rejects any deposit. This results in the vault not reaching its full capacity.

## Impact
The immediate impact is the inability of the vault to fill to capacity due to small remaining capacity being rejected. This issue can prevent the vault from starting, as both the fixed and variable sides need to be fully funded before operations can commence. As a result:
1. Fixed side participants may not be able to complete their deposit.
2. The vault will remain inactive, delaying or entirely blocking yield generation for both fixed and variable participants.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, allow deposits that fully fill the remaining vault capacity without requiring the `minimumFixedDeposit` constraint. Adjust the logic so that if the remaining capacity is less than the `minimumFixedDeposit`, the final deposit can still be processed as long as it fills the vault. This will ensure that both fixed and variable sides can be fully funded, allowing the vault to begin operations.

```solidity
if (remainingCapacity > 0 && remainingCapacity < minimumFixedDeposit && remainingCapacity != exact final deposit) {
    revert("Deposit size too small.");
}
```
