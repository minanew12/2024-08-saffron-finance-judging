# Missing Check for variableSideCapacity != 0 in deposit Function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `LidoVault.sol` contract, the `deposit` function currently checks if `fixedSideCapacity` is not zero to ensure that the vault has been `initialized` properly. However, there is no corresponding check for `variableSideCapacity` to ensure it is also not zero. This could potentially lead to issues if `variableSideCapacity` is not set correctly during initialization.

```solidity
 function deposit(uint256 side) external payable {
    // fixedSideCapacity will not be zero of initialized
    require(fixedSideCapacity != 0, "NI");//-cheks fixedsideCapacity is not zero
    require(!isStarted(), "DAS");//-avoids deposits after start
    require(side == FIXED || side == VARIABLE, "IS");//-can be anyone,fixed or variable
    require(msg.value >= minimumDepositAmount, "MDA");//-amount cannot be less than minimumdepositAmount

    uint256 amount = msg.value;//-assining msg.value to amount
    if (side == FIXED) {//-logic for side = fixed
      // Fixed side deposits
```


## Impact
if `varibleSideCapacity` is `0` then users cannot deposit eth

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an explicit check for `variableSideCapacity != 0` in the deposit function to ensure that both capacities are validated before proceeding with the deposit logic.
