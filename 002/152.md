# Variable users can deposit amount less than `minimumDepositAmount` deviating from the protocols design.

## Summary
Protocol doesnt check whether the amount deposited by Variable users is >= `minimumDepositAmount` but at the same time it checks the whether the `remainingCapacity` is greater than or equal to `minimumDepositAmount`.
## Vulnerability Detail

Variable users and fixed users are only allowed to deposit amount >=  `minimumDepositAmount` .Check is implemented for fixed Users but not for variable.

```solidity
  /// @notice Minimum amount of ETH that can be deposited for variable or fixed side users
  uint256 public immutable minimumDepositAmount = 0.01 ether;
  ```

## Impact
Variable users can deposit amount less than `minimumDepositAmount` deviating from the protocols design.
