# Malicious users can manipulate the remaining capacity to prolong the vault's start indefinitely

## Summary
A malicious user can manipulate the Saffron vault's deposit and withdrawal mechanisms to prevent the vault from ever starting. 

By strategically withdrawing and depositing funds between the fixed and variable sides, the attacker can keep one side just below full capacity, blocking legitimate users from fully funding the vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vault requires both the fixed and variable sides to be fully funded before it starts. 

A user can withdraw their funds from a side that has reached full capacity and then immediately deposit those funds into the other side, effectively preventing both sides from being fully funded simultaneously.

Let's consider the following scenario:
For simplicity, let's say the minimum deposit is 1 ETH and the full capacity is 1000 ETH for both sides.

- the attacker deposits 1 ETH on both the fixed and variable sides.
- Legitimate users deposit enough to fill the fixed side to 1000 ETH and the variable side to 999 ETH.
The key part here is that one of the sides will get filled up first and we(the attacker) have stakes in both sides. In our example, the fixed side gets filled up, while the variable is almost filled. In reality, it doesn't matter if the variable side has 999eth or 990eth or any other number.
- A legitimate user attempts to deposit 1 ETH into the variable side to fill it.
- The attacker front-runs the legitimate user's transaction by withdrawing their 1 ETH from the fixed side (bringing it to 999 ETH) and depositing 1 ETH into the variable side (bringing it to 1000 ETH).
This can and would be done in the same transaction with the use of a smart contract that withdraws from one side, and deposits to the other side. 
Let's clarify what the front run transaction does - 1) it withdraws from the already filled vault(fixed in our example) and 2) deposits into the yet-to-be-filled side(variable in our example) so that the legitimate user's transaction fails. 1) is done so we don't reach a state where both of them are filled and 2) is done to deny the legit user's transaction and ensure the attacker has stake in the filled vault
- The legitimate user's deposit fails(because the capacity is already reached), and the vault cannot start since the fixed side is now at 999 ETH while the variable is 1000 ETH.

This cycle continues indefinitely as the attacker constantly withdraws and deposits between sides, preventing the vault from ever reaching full capacity.

The key part is that the attacker makes sure that he has stake in the side that is filled and is ready to front-run legitimate depositors to the other side by withdrawing from the filled and depositing into the not-yet-filled side. 

This process can run indefinitely by the attacker constantly switching sides making sure that he'll always have a stake in the filled side which he can withdraw and then deposit into the other side. 

This can be done with success by using bots or keepers that monitor the vault's state as well as the mempool and act accordingly so the attack can be carried out, using high gas fees to make frontrunning highly likely. 
## Impact
Denial of Service - effectively blocks the vault from starting indefinitely, preventing legitimate users from participating and locking their funds in a state where the vault never activates.

From `LidoVault.sol::deposit()`:
Code snippet on why the legit user's deposit will fail:
```solidity
require(amount <= fixedSideCapacity - fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply, "OED");
```
Code snippet on why the vault will never start(needs both sides to be fully filled):
```solidity
    if (
      fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply == fixedSideCapacity && 
      variableBearerTokenTotalSupply == variableSideCapacity
    ) {
      startTime = block.timestamp;
      endTime = block.timestamp + duration;
      
      fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = stakingBalance();
      fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply = fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply;
      
      emit VaultStarted(block.timestamp, msg.sender);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement measures to prevent frequent withdrawals and deposits by the same user before the vault starts. For example, a reasonable limit on how many deposits and withdrawals can be made by the same user and/or a timelock that needs to pass after you deposited before you can withdraw. Even a small timelock like 5min will solve this attack.
