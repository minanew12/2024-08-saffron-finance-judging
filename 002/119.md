# Logic Bug in deposit Function Prevents Vault from Reaching Full Capacity

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit` function in the LidoVault contract contains a logic bug that can prevent the vault from reaching full capacity under certain conditions. Specifically, the issue arises from the checks on the remaining capacity for both fixed and variable side deposits. These checks ensure that the remaining capacity is either zero or at least the minimum deposit amount. However, there is a scenario where the remaining capacity could be less than the minimum deposit amount but greater than zero, which would prevent further deposits and leave the vault in a state where it cannot reach full capacity.

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 side) external payable {
    // fixedSideCapacity will not be zero of initialized
    require(fixedSideCapacity != 0, "NI");
    require(!isStarted(), "DAS");
    require(side == FIXED || side == VARIABLE, "IS");
    require(msg.value >= minimumDepositAmount, "MDA");

    uint256 amount = msg.value;
    if (side == FIXED) {
        // Fixed side deposits

        uint256 minimumFixedDeposit = fixedSideCapacity.mulDiv(minimumFixedDepositBps, 10_000);
        require(amount >= minimumFixedDeposit, "MFD");

        // no refunds allowed
        require(amount <= fixedSideCapacity - fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply, "OED");
        // do not allow remaining capacity to be less than minimum fixed deposit bps
        uint256 remainingCapacity = fixedSideCapacity - fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply - amount;
        require(remainingCapacity == 0 || remainingCapacity >= minimumFixedDeposit, "RC");

        // Stake on Lido
        /// returns stETH, and returns amount of Lido shares issued for the staked ETH
        uint256 stETHBalanceBefore = stakingBalance();
        uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
        require(shares > 0, "ISS");
        // stETH transfered from Lido != ETH deposited to Lido - some rounding error
        uint256 stETHReceived = (stakingBalance() - stETHBalanceBefore);
        require((stETHReceived >= amount) || (amount - stETHReceived <= LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH), "ULD");
        emit FundsStaked(amount, shares, msg.sender);

        // Mint claim tokens
        fixedClaimToken[msg.sender] += shares;
        fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply += shares;
        fixedETHDepositToken[msg.sender] += amount;
        fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply += amount;

        emit FixedFundsDeposited(amount, shares, msg.sender);
    } else {
        // Variable side deposits

        // no refunds allowed
        require(amount <= variableSideCapacity - variableBearerTokenTotalSupply, "OED");
        uint256 remainingCapacity = variableSideCapacity - variableBearerTokenTotalSupply - amount;
        require(remainingCapacity == 0 || remainingCapacity >= minimumDepositAmount, "RC");

        // Mint bearer tokens
        variableBearerToken[msg.sender] += amount;
        variableBearerTokenTotalSupply += amount;

        emit VariableFundsDeposited(amount, msg.sender);
    }

    // Start the vault if we're at capacity
    if (
        fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply == fixedSideCapacity &&
        variableBearerTokenTotalSupply == variableSideCapacity
    ) {
        startTime = block.timestamp;
        endTime = block.timestamp + duration;
        fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = stakingBalance();
        fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply = fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply;
        emit VaultStarted(block.timestamp, msg.sender);
    }
}

```

**Example Scenario:**
Consider the following scenario to illustrate the issue:

* Suppose fixedSideCapacity is 1000 ETH, minimumFixedDepositBps is 500 (5%), and minimumDepositAmount is 0.01 ETH.
* If the current fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply is 995 ETH, the remaining capacity is 5 ETH.
* The minimum fixed deposit is 50 ETH (5% of 1000 ETH).
* The condition require(remainingCapacity == 0 || remainingCapacity >= minimumFixedDeposit, "RC"); would fail because 5 * * ETH is less than 50 ETH, preventing any further deposits.
This leaves the vault in a state where it cannot reach full capacity, and the vault will never start.

## Tool used

The vault will never reach full capacity, preventing it from transitioning to the started phase. This means that users who have already deposited funds will not be able to benefit from the vault's intended functionality
