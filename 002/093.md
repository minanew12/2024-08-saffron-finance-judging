# Potencial Reentrancy in LidoVault::deposit function


## Summary
The `deposit` function doesn't follow the checks-effects-interactions(CEI) pattern strictly. The `lido.submit` call is made before updating state variables, which could potentially be exploited.

## Vulnerability Detail

The external call to `lido.submit` occurs before some of the state changes (updating `fixedClaimToken`, `fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply`, etc.).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L351

```javascript

    uint256 stETHBalanceBefore = stakingBalance();
@>    uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
    require(shares > 0, "ISS");  
      // stETH transfered from Lido != ETH deposited to Lido - some rounding error
    uint256 stETHReceived = (stakingBalance() - stETHBalanceBefore);
    require((stETHReceived >= amount) || (amount - stETHReceived <= LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH), "ULD");
    emit FundsStaked(amount, shares, msg.sender);

    // Mint claim tokens
    fixedClaimToken[msg.sender] += shares;
    fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply += shares;
    fixedETHDepositToken[msg.sender] += amount;
    fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply += amount;

    emit FixedFundsDeposited(amount, shares, msg.sender);

```


A user could have `fallback/receive` function that calls the `LidoVault::deposit`  again and claim another refund.They could continue the cycle till the contract balance is drained.

## Impact
drain the token or claim until finished.

## Recommended Mitigation: To prevent this we should have the `deposit` fucntion update before making the external call. Additionally, we should move the event emit above as well.

1. Perform all checks first
2. Update the contract's state
3. Make the external calls at last
