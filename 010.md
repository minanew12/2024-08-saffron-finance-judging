# The vault does not implement any ERC721TokenReceiver method making it imposible to unstake from the lidoWithdrawalQueue address.

### Details
Based on Lido architecture, upon withdrawal requests, an ERC721 is usually sent to the `msg.sender` which is in this case the vault. [Proof of this](https://github.com/lidofinance/docs/blob/main/docs/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721.md).

User request withdrawal by calling `LidoVault::withdraw`.

The problem is that `lidoWithdrawalQueue.requestWithdrawals` will safeTransfer an NFT to the `msg.sender` which in this case will be the vault as proof of request withdrawal. But the vault is not compatible with safeTransfer because the implementation LidoVault.sol does not have any ERC721TokenReceiver method required by safeTransfer.

It is important to mention that the reason the test passed is because of the mock that was used.

```
/// @title Saffron Fixed Income Lido Vault
contract LidoVault is ILidoVaultInitializer, ILidoVault {
```

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol
```
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) public virtual {
        transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
        ERC721Utils.checkOnERC721Received(_msgSender(), from, to, tokenId, data);
    }
```
