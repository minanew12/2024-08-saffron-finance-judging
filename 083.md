# Vulnerability in `LidoVault::_claimWithdrawals` function:  `unlockReceive` and `address(this).balance` leads to Potential Overpayments

  ## Summary
  The `LidoVault::_claimWithdrawals` function allows users to claim withdrawals, but it does in a manner that exposes users to potential `overpayments` due to `unlockReceive` flag and `address(this).balance.
  ## Vulnerability Detail
  The `LidoVault::_claimWithdrawals` function sets `unlockReceive` to `true` at the beginning of the function and resets it to `false` at the end. However, this flag is not properly protected, allowing arbitrary users to send ETH to the contract during the withdrawal process. As a result, the `withdrawnAmount` calculation becomes inflated, which leads to unintended overpayments.
  ## Impact
  Financial Losses: Users may receive more ETH during withdrawal process, which leads to financial losses to contract owners or other users.
 
  ## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L1168-L1185
  ```solidity
  function _claimWithdrawals(address user, uint256[] memory requestIds) internal returns (uint256) {
// @audit-issue: contract receives ETH from any user when true, which makes address(this).balance gets inflated
@>    unlockReceive = true; 
@>    uint256 beforeBalance = address(this).balance;

    // Claim Ether for the burned stETH positions
    // this will fail if the request is not finalized
    for (uint i = 0; i < requestIds.length; i++) {
      lidoWithdrawalQueue.claimWithdrawal(requestIds[i]); // amount gets transferred from `lido` to this contract.
    }
// @audit-issue: contract balance inflated(claimed balance + arbitrary user's ETh deposit)
@>    uint256 withdrawnAmount = address(this).balance - beforeBalance; // user receives more amount than intended.
    require(withdrawnAmount > 0, "IWA");

    emit WithdrawalClaimed(withdrawnAmount, requestIds, user);

    unlockReceive = false;
    return withdrawnAmount;
  }
  ```
  ## Proof of Concept-1
  1. An user requested for withdrawal which triggered `LidoVault::_claimWithdrawals` function.
  2. Now `unlockReceive` sets to `true` which allows `LidoVault::receive` function to receive ETH.
  3. Assume the ` uint256 beforeBalance = address(this).balance;` is `1000 Ether`. 
  4. Arbitrary user sends `10 ether` to this contract, because `unlockReceive = true`.
  5. Now this line `lidoWithdrawalQueue.claimWithdrawal(requestIds[i]);` triggered, where `lidoWithdrawalQueue` transfers the amount to this contract.
  6. Assume `lidoWithdrawalQueue` sends `100 ether` to this contract.
  7. So, `100 ether` is intended withdrawal that should be received by the user.
  8. But this line `uint256 withdrawnAmount = address(this).balance - beforeBalance;` makes `withdrawn Amount = (1000 + 10 +100) - 1000 ether = 110 ether` .
  9. So, user receives more ether than intended.
 
  ## Proof of Concept-2
1. `user1` requested for withdrawal which triggered `LidoVault::_claimWithdrawals` function, which sets `unlockReceive = true`.
2. Now while `_claimWithdrawals::for` loop executing, `user2` initiated his withdrawal request and his transaction is executed first which sets `unlockReceive = false`.
3. since `unlockReceive = false`, the contract won't receive any incoming ether.
4. So, `user1's` transaction gets reverted.
  ## Tool used
  
  Manual Review
  
  ## Recommendation
 Keep track of withdrawn amounts instead of relying on `address(this).balance`.
