# Funds Can Become Stuck Due to Lido Withdrawal Minimums

## Summary
The `LidoVault` contract enforces a minimum withdrawal amount of `100 stETH` through the `MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT` constant in the `_requestWithdraw` function. If the contract's total `stETH` balance falls below `100 stETH`, users are unable to initiate withdrawal requests. Additionally, the contract lacks alternative withdrawal mechanisms, which may result in users' funds becoming permanently locked when the `stETH` balance is insufficient.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_requestWithdraw` function, the contract checks if the `stETHAmount` is greater than or equal to `MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`:

	    function _requestWithdraw(address user, uint256 stETHAmount) internal  
	    returns (uint256[] memory) {
			// ...
			require(stETHAmount >= MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT, "WM");
			// ...
	     }

This means if the contract's total `stETH` balance drops below `100 stETH`, the condition will fail, and users will be unable to request withdrawals.

## Impact
If the contract's `stETH` balance falls below `100 stETH`, users will be unable to withdraw their funds, potentially leaving them permanently locked without any alternative withdrawal options.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a fallback mechanism allowing users to withdraw their proportional share of `stETH` directly when the contract's balance falls below `100 stETH`. Alternatively, accumulate smaller withdrawal requests until they meet the minimum threshold for a Lido withdrawal.
