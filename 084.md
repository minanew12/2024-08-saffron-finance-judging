# Due to using strict > comparison operator, accumulated Lido earnings are distributed with a delay

## Summary
There's an assertion here in `withdraw`'s **vault-is-in-progress STATE** flow to see when the earnings on Lido are high enough for their distribution to not be blocked by the `MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT` native Lido limit:
```solidity
          // staking earnings have accumulated on Lido
          if (lidoStETHBalance > fixedETHDeposits + minStETHWithdrawalAmount()) {
```

## Vulnerability Detail
However, the earnings are already sufficient enough for the distribution when the `lidoStETHBalance` is at least equal to the `fixedETHDeposits + minStETHWithdrawalAmount()`.

Please note that `fixedETHDeposits` here is `==` `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity`.

## Impact
In some edge case, there'll be a delay when the variable-side withdrawer will not get the portion of the distributed and accumulated Lido earnings, because the `if(...)` check will not be fired on time.

And he will lose a portion of the earnings fee that he **may be entitled to**.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
Consider using a more loose comparison operator here to prevent that kind of edge case that may be irritating for the users.
```diff
          // staking earnings have accumulated on Lido
-         if (lidoStETHBalance > fixedETHDeposits + minStETHWithdrawalAmount()) {
+         if (lidoStETHBalance >= fixedETHDeposits + minStETHWithdrawalAmount()) {
```
