# Vault Balance Manipulation Through stETH Transfers

## Summary

A vault is started when both the `fixedSideCapacity` and `variableSideCapacity` are fully deposited.
For example, the vault might require 1000 ETH for the fixed side and 100 ETH for the variable side.
The `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` is set based on the vault's total staked ETH (including stETH) at the moment 
of initiation, determined by:

```solidity
fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = stakingBalance();
``` 

However, this balance can be manipulated by directly transferring stETH to the vault contract before the vault starts.
For example, a user could `transfer` 1000 stETH to the vault from a wallet. This results in:

```solidity
fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = 2000 stETH;
``` 

Despite only 1000 ETH being the designated capacity for the fixed side, the staked balance effectively doubles to 2000 stETH.
As a result, the vault’s initial fixed balance is inflated. However, for the user not to lose funds, 
the fixed side must still meet the full amount of fixed capacity, so other users cannot claim his transfered stETH.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (
      fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply == fixedSideCapacity &&
      variableBearerTokenTotalSupply == variableSideCapacity
    ) {
      startTime = block.timestamp;
      endTime = block.timestamp + duration;
      fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = stakingBalance();
      fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply = fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply;
      emit VaultStarted(block.timestamp, msg.sender);
    }
)
```

Additionally, this manipulation can happen after the vault has been created. 
If a user transfers stETH to the vault after it has started, it is recognized as part of the vault's staked earnings. 
This would allow a user who fully funds the variable side to:

- Receive the full amount of the transferred stETH back.
- Accumulate the yield generated by the transferred amount.

This essentially allows the variable user to benefit from the transferred stETH without the 
fixed users gaining a proportional reward, creating an imbalance in how rewards are distributed.

## Context

To contextualize this issue, it's important to note that:

["It is acceptable to create contracts where, for example, Fixed capacity is much smaller than Variable Capacity. 
Contracts with those parameters will never be profitable for Variable users, and we assume no one will deposit in them."    ](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/509)

This highlights the inherent design risks in the vault's capacity structure.

## Impact

The vulnerability allows users to manipulate the vault’s fixed capacity, creating an unfair advantage for either fixed or variable depositors. This can lead to inflated yield calculations and imbalanced rewards.

## Remediation

Consider leveraging the `getPooledEthByShares` function, which utilizes the shares submitted via the deposit function.

```solidity
if (
      fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply == fixedSideCapacity &&
      variableBearerTokenTotalSupply == variableSideCapacity
    ) {
      startTime = block.timestamp;
      endTime = block.timestamp + duration;
--      fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = stakingBalance();
++      fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity = lido.getPooledEthByShares(fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply);
        fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply = fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply;
        emit VaultStarted(block.timestamp, msg.sender);
    }
)
```
