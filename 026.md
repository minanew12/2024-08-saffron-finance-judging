# Locked Ether Due to Precision Loss in claimFixedPremium Function

## Summary
The claimFixedPremium function of the contract contains an issue where Ether can become locked due to precision loss in a mulDiv calculation. The Ether left from the operation (resulting from remainder values) is not claimable by users, causing the contract to accumulate locked funds over time. As a potential solution, the unclaimed Ether could be stored or staked via Lido to prevent permanent loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the claimFixedPremium function, the calculation to distribute Ether is:

`uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply);`

The mulDiv function calculates claimBal * variableSideCapacity / fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply. However, if there is a remainder from this operation (claimBal * variableSideCapacity % fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply), that portion of Ether remains undistributed. Over time, this accumulated Ether remains locked in the contract without a way for users to claim it.

No mechanism currently exists to handle the remainder, leading to a scenario where small amounts of Ether accumulate and are permanently lost.

## Impact
This issue causes a growing amount of Ether to be locked within the contract, as small portions of each transaction remain undistributed. As this problem persists over time, the total amount of locked Ether could become significant, effectively reducing user rewards and causing financial loss.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L403
The vulnerability arises from the remainder in the division, which is not handled, leaving some Ether locked in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider storing unclaimable Ether resulting from the precision loss in Lido or a similar staking protocol. This would allow the contract to stake the unclaimed Ether and earn rewards, rather than leaving it locked and inaccessible. Alternatively, find a way to fairly redistribute the remaining Ether to users or implement a rounding mechanism that prevents significant amounts from being left unclaimed.
