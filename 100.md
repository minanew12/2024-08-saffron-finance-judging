# Cross-Chain Replay Attack Vulnerability in createVault Function

## Summary

duplicate of https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse-findings/issues/154 

check this too https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse-findings/issues/154#issuecomment-1332212179

## Vulnerability Detail

The `createVault` function does not include the chain.id in its parameters or perform any check to ensure that the transaction is being executed on the correct chain. This omission makes it possible for an attacker to replay a transaction on a different network, potentially leading to the creation of the same vault address and unauthorized access to funds.

```solidity
 /// @notice Deploys a new vault
  function createVault(
    uint256 _fixedSideCapacity,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint256 _variableSideCapacity
  ) public virtual {
    // Deploy vault (Note: this does not run constructor)
    address vaultAddress = Clones.clone(vaultContract);

    require(vaultAddress != address(0), "FTC");

    // Store vault info
    uint256 vaultId = nextVaultId++;
    vaultInfo[vaultId] = VaultInfo({creator: msg.sender, addr: vaultAddress});
    vaultAddrToId[vaultAddress] = vaultId;

    InitializationParams memory params = InitializationParams({
      vaultId: vaultId,
      duration: _duration,
      fixedSideCapacity: _fixedSideCapacity,
      variableSideCapacity: _variableSideCapacity,
      earlyExitFeeBps: earlyExitFeeBps,
      protocolFeeBps: protocolFeeBps,
      protocolFeeReceiver: protocolFeeReceiver
    });

    // Initialize vault
    ILidoVault(vaultAddress).initialize(params);

    emit VaultCreated(
      vaultId,
      _duration,
      _fixedSideCapacity,
      _variableSideCapacity,
      earlyExitFeeBps,
      protocolFeeBps,
      protocolFeeReceiver,
      msg.sender,
      vaultAddress
    );
  }
```


## Impact

The createVault function in VaultFactory.sol is susceptible to cross-chain replay attacks. This vulnerability can lead to unintended consequences, such as unauthorized creation of vaults or theft of funds, if a transaction valid on one blockchain is replayed on another blockchain.
