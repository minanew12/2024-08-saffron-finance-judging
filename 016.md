# Redundant Withdrawal Condition and Ambiguous Error Messages in LidoVault.sol

## Summary
In the LidoVault.sol contract, a redundant conditional check in the withdrawal logic and the use of identical error messages for different conditions can lead to blocked withdrawals and user confusion. Specifically, the unnecessary check on unfinalized withdrawal requests affects withdrawals in progress, and the reuse of the same error message obscures the specific action users need to take to resolve different issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core issue arises in the following require statement:
`require(
    fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].requestIds.length == 0 &&
    fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0,
    "WAR"
);`
This condition attempts to ensure that users have no active or unfinalized withdrawal requests before initiating a new one. However, the check on fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0 is unnecessary when the withdrawal is related to the ongoing vault process. This check relates to unfinalized withdrawals that were initiated but not completed, which does not need to be considered for withdrawals in progress.

## Senario
1. A user deposits into the fixed vault.
2. The user requests a withdrawal but does not finalize it using finalizeVaultNotStartedFixedWithdrawals(), leaving an entry in fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds.
3. The user deposits again and tries to initiate a new withdrawal in progress.
4. The contract blocks the withdrawal because the unfinalized withdrawal exists, even though it is unrelated to the current in-progress request.
This is compounded by the fact that the same error message "WAR" is reused in different require checks throughout the contract:
`require(fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0, "WAR");
require(fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].requestIds.length == 0 && 
    fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0, "WAR");
require(variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0, "WAR");
`
Each of these checks involves different logic and requires different corrective actions (e.g., finalizing unstarted withdrawals vs. claiming ongoing withdrawals), but the identical error message offers no insight into what the user needs to do. This creates confusion and makes it difficult for users to determine which function to call to resolve the issue.

## Impact
**1. Denial of Service (DoS):**
Users are prevented from withdrawing from the vault in progress if they have unfinalized withdrawal requests. This unnecessarily restricts access to their funds, potentially leading to a prolonged lockout.
**2. User Confusion:**
The use of the same error message for different conditions makes it difficult for users to determine what action they need to take. This could lead to users attempting incorrect actions, further delaying resolution and increasing frustration.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**1.Remove the Redundant Condition:**

The check for fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0 should be removed in the context of ongoing withdrawals, as it is irrelevant to the process of withdrawing from the vault in progress. The corrected require statement should be:
`require(
    fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].requestIds.length == 0,
    "WAR"
);
`
**2.Use Specific Error Messages:**

The error messages should be revised to reflect the specific nature of the issue. This will give users clear instructions on what they need to do, avoiding confusion and delays. For example:

require(
    fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0,
    "Unfinalized withdrawal exists. Call finalizeVaultNotStartedFixedWithdrawals().");

require(
    fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].requestIds.length == 0,
    "Ongoing withdrawal exists. Call claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal()."
);

By making these adjustments, the contract will provide more precise error handling, preventing unnecessary withdrawal blocks and ensuring users understand how to resolve issues.
