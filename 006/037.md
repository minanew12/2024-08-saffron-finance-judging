# `LidoVault` Computes Undue `earlyExitFees`

### Summary

The `earlyExitFees` are miscalculated when handling an early fixed exit.

### Root Cause

In [`calculateFixedEarlyExitFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L982C12-L982C39), when trying to compute a share of the `earlyExitFees` for the fixed withdrawal's premium, the `earlyExitFee` is increased by a single basis point:

```solidity
/// @audit 1e18 down to 0 as duration increases
uint256 remainingProportion = (endTime > timestampRequested ? endTime - timestampRequested : 0).mulDiv(
  1e18,
  duration
);

// Calculate the scaling fee based on the linear factor and earlyExitFeeBps
/// @audit Reduces the early exit fees as duration increases.
/// @audit Increases the worst-case fee by one basis point for every calculation.
uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv((1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);
```

As we can see, instead of scaling the upfrontPremium by a diminishing `earlyExitFeeBps`, the `msg.sender` is charged an additional undue basis point.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Fixed withdrawal user submits a withdrawal claim whilst `isStarted() && !isEnded()`.

### Impact

1. Each early fixed withdrawal is charged at a unanimous increased rate of 0.01% more than intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
- uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv((1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);
+ uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv(earlyExitFeeBps.mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);
```
