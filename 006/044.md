# `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` will overcharge fixed-side users

### Summary

The incorrect addition of `1` to `earlyExitFeeBps` in the `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` function will cause an overcharging fee for fixed-side users as the contract misapplies the basis points during early exit fee calculations.


### Root Cause

In [`LidoVault.sol`](https://github.com/saffron-finance/lido-fiv/blob/7246b6651c8affffe17faa4d2984975102a65d81/contracts/LidoVault.sol), the [`calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L982-L998) adds `1` to `earlyExitFeeBps` when calculating the `earlyExitFees`, leading to an incorrect fee multiplier.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Fixed-side user** needs to **initiate an early withdrawal request** by calling the `withdraw` function with `side == FIXED`.
2. The `earlyExitFeeBps` must be **greater than 0**.
3. The `duration` must be **properly set** and greater than **0**.
4. The `timestampRequested` must be **before** the `endTime` to trigger early exit fees.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. **Fixed-side user** calls the `withdraw` function with `side == FIXED` before the vault ends.
2. The `withdraw` function invokes `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` with the user's `upfrontPremium` and `timestampRequested`.
3. Inside `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees`, the calculation incorrectly adds `1` to `earlyExitFeeBps`:
    ```solidity
    uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv(
        (1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18),
        10000
    );
    ```
4. This results in `earlyExitFees` being **significantly higher** than intended due to the improper multiplier.
5. The user is charged an **excessive fee**, receiving less ETH upon withdrawal.


### Impact

Fixed-side users suffer an **overcharging of early exit fees**, resulting in financial losses. This undermines user trust and the economic integrity of the protocol, potentially leading to a **loss of user funds** and **reputation damage** for the protocol.

### PoC

1. **User A** deposits **100 ETH** into the fixed side.
2. **User A** decides to withdraw **50 ETH** early by calling:
    ```solidity
    vault.withdraw(FIXED);
    ```
3. The `withdraw` function calls `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` with:
    - `upfrontPremium = 100 ETH`
    - `timestampRequested = current timestamp`
4. Inside `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees`, the fee is calculated as:
    ```solidity
    uint256 earlyExitFees = 100 ether.mulDiv(
        (1 + 100).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), // Suppose earlyExitFeeBps = 100 (1%)
        10000
    );
    ```
    - `(1 + 100) = 101`
    - `earlyExitFees = 100 ether * (101 * remainingProportion / 1e18) / 10000`
    - This results in `earlyExitFees` being **over 1 ETH** instead of the intended **1 ETH** (for `earlyExitFeeBps = 100`).
5. **User A** receives **less ETH** than expected due to the inflated fee.


### Mitigation

Correct the fee calculation by removing the unnecessary addition of `1` to `earlyExitFeeBps`. The `earlyExitFees` should be calculated directly based on `earlyExitFeeBps` without the extra increment.

```diff
- uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv(
-     (1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18),
-     10000
- );
+ uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv(
+     earlyExitFeeBps.mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18),
+     10000
+ );
```
