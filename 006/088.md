# Incorrect `FixedEarlyExitFees` calculation leads to significantly reduced fees

## Summary
The `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` function has an error in the percentage calculation for early exit fees, potentially resulting in significantly lower fees than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `calculateFixedEarlyExitFees` function, the early exit fee is calculated using the following formula:

```js
uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv((1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);
```

The intention is to calculate a yield using the formula `(1 + r)`, where `r` is the rate expressed in basis points. However, since the calculation works in basis points, the "1" in this formula should actually be represented as 10,000 basis points.


## Impact

- Early exit fees will be much lower than intended. For example, if `earlyExitFeeBps` is 500 (5%), the current calculation will use 0,05 instead of 1.05 as the yield factor.
- Users exiting early will pay much lower fees than intended, potentially as low as 1/21th of the intended amount.
- The protocol will lose a significant amount of revenue from early exit fees.
- The reduced exit fees may incentivize more early exits and reduce incentives for depositors that will earn the fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the following :

```js
uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv((10_000 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);
```
