# Unsafe Handling of Early Exit Fees

## Summary

The early exit fee calculation in calculateFixedEarlyExitFees may cause incorrect behavior if the vault hasn't started or if incorrect parameters are passed. There could be cases where users are charged over 100% of their deposit due to faulty fee logic.

## Vulnerability Detail

In certain edge cases, such as when timestampRequested is near or equal to startTime, or if there's rounding during the fee calculation, the exit fee could exceed reasonable limits. Users may loss their funds due to unreasonable thing and be responsible for total fees in their whole stake amount.

```solidity
function calculateFixedEarlyExitFees(
    uint256 upfrontPremium,
    uint256 timestampRequested
  ) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 remainingProportion = (endTime > timestampRequested ? endTime - timestampRequested : 0).mulDiv(
      1e18,
      duration
    );

    // Calculate the scaling fee based on the linear factor and earlyExitFeeBps
    uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv( (1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);

    // Calculate the amount to be paid back of their original upfront claimed premium, not influenced by quadratic scaling
    earlyExitFees += upfrontPremium - upfrontPremium.mulDiv(timestampRequested - startTime, duration);

    return earlyExitFees;
  }
```

```solidity
function claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(address user) internal returns (uint256) {
    if (user == address(0)) return 0;

    WithdrawalRequest memory request = fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
    uint256[] memory requestIds = request.requestIds;
    require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");

    uint256 upfrontPremium = userToFixedUpfrontPremium[user];

    delete userToFixedUpfrontPremium[user];
    delete fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];

    // uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
    // for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    //   if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == user) {
    //     delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
    //   }
    // }

    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);

    uint256 earlyExitFees = calculateFixedEarlyExitFees(upfrontPremium, request.timestamp);
    // make sure, that earlyExitFee cant be higher than initial deposit
    earlyExitFees = Math.min(earlyExitFees, amountWithdrawn);

    // add earlyExitFees to earnings for variable side
    feeEarnings += earlyExitFees;

    emit LidoWithdrawalFinalized(user, requestIds, FIXED, true, isEnded());

    return amountWithdrawn - earlyExitFees;
  }
 ```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check again the calculating logic of earlyexitfee and change into flexible and invaluable thing or limit the time for earlyexit.
So we can prevent the unexpected loss of funds.
