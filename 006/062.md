# Users will pay 0.01% more early exit fees.

## Summary
`LidoVault.calculateFixedEarlyExitFees()` function uses `1 + earlyExitFeeBps` instead of `earlyExitFeeBps` in calculation of early exit fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
`LidoVault.withdraw()` function is following.
```solidity
  function calculateFixedEarlyExitFees(
    uint256 upfrontPremium,
    uint256 timestampRequested
  ) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 remainingProportion = (endTime > timestampRequested ? endTime - timestampRequested : 0).mulDiv(
      1e18,
      duration
    );

    // Calculate the scaling fee based on the linear factor and earlyExitFeeBps
992:uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv( (1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);

    // Calculate the amount to be paid back of their original upfront claimed premium, not influenced by quadratic scaling
    earlyExitFees += upfrontPremium - upfrontPremium.mulDiv(timestampRequested - startTime, duration);

    return earlyExitFees;
  }
```
As can be seen, it uses mistakenly `1 + earlyExitFeeBps` instead of `earlyExitFeeBps` in calculation of early exit fees.

## Impact
0.01% more early exit fee rate will be applied to users who don't know about it. Users will pay 0.01% more early exit fees. Loss of users funds.

## Recommendation
Modify `LidoVault.calculateFixedEarlyExitFees()` function as follows.
```solidity
  function calculateFixedEarlyExitFees(
    uint256 upfrontPremium,
    uint256 timestampRequested
  ) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 remainingProportion = (endTime > timestampRequested ? endTime - timestampRequested : 0).mulDiv(
      1e18,
      duration
    );

    // Calculate the scaling fee based on the linear factor and earlyExitFeeBps
--  uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv( (1 + earlyExitFeeBps).mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);
++  uint256 earlyExitFees = upfrontPremium.mulDiv( earlyExitFeeBps.mulDiv(remainingProportion, 1e18), 10000);

    // Calculate the amount to be paid back of their original upfront claimed premium, not influenced by quadratic scaling
    earlyExitFees += upfrontPremium - upfrontPremium.mulDiv(timestampRequested - startTime, duration);

    return earlyExitFees;
  }
```
