# Updating `protocolFeeBps/protocolFeeReceiverearlyExitFeeBps` in `VaultFactory` is not synchronized with updating them in `LidoVault`

### Summary

When initializing [LidoVault:133](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/VaultFactory.sol#L133) in contract `VaultFactory`,  the values `earlyExitFeeBps/protocolFeeBps/protocolFeeReceiver` in the current contract are used. However, when updating these variables, they are not updated to the already initialized  `LidoVault` contracts.

### Root Cause

These parameters(`earlyExitFeeBps/protocolFeeBps/protocolFeeReceiver`) are only can be update in contract [VaultFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/VaultFactory.sol#L90-L104).

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

These parameters can only be assigned at initialization time and will not change as `VaultFactory ` changes. This may cause the fee 
 and fee receiver to be out of sync with the factory.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

1. `ILidoVaultInitializer .sol`
```solidity
interface ILidoVaultInitializer {
  /// @notice All the required parameters to initialize a vault
  struct InitializationParams {
    uint256 vaultId;
    uint256 duration;
    uint256 fixedSideCapacity;
    uint256 variableSideCapacity;
    address vaultFactory;
  }
}
```
2. `VaultFactory.sol`
```solidity
#Line: 122

    InitializationParams memory params = InitializationParams({
      vaultId: vaultId,
      duration: _duration,
      fixedSideCapacity: _fixedSideCapacity,
      variableSideCapacity: _variableSideCapacity,
      vaultFactory: address(this)
    });
```
3.  `LidoVault.sol` :
- import `IVaultFactory` to get these parameters (earlyExitFeeBps/protocolFeeBps/protocolFeeReceiver)
- make changes:
```solidity
earlyExitFeeBps         --> IVaultFactory(vaultFactory).earlyExitFeeBps()
protocolFeeBps         --> IVaultFactory(vaultFactory).protocolFeeBps()
protocolFeeReceiver  --> IVaultFactory(vaultFactory).protocolFeeReceiver()
```
