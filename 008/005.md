# Repeated Premium Claim Exploit in LidoVault

## Summary
The `LidoVault` contract's `claimFixedPremium` function lacks proper validation to ensure that a user can only claim their fixed side premium once. This allows malicious users to repeatedly claim the premium, leading to unfair distribution and potential financial losses for the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the absence of checks to prevent multiple claims of the fixed side premium by the same user.
```solidity
395:   function claimFixedPremium() external {
396:@=>  require(isStarted(), "CBS");
---
399:@=>  uint256 claimBal = fixedClaimToken[msg.sender];
400:@=>  require(claimBal > 0, "NCT");
---
403:     uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply);
---
406:     userToFixedUpfrontPremium[msg.sender] = sendAmount;
---
409:     fixedBearerToken[msg.sender] += claimBal;
410:     fixedBearerTokenTotalSupply += claimBal;
---
413:@=>  fixedClaimToken[msg.sender] = 0;
414:@=>  fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply -= claimBal;
---
416:     (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: sendAmount}("");
417:     require(sent, "ETF");
418:     emit FixedPremiumClaimed(sendAmount, claimBal, msg.sender);
419:   }
```
```solidity
require(isStarted(), "CBS");

uint256 claimBal = fixedClaimToken[msg.sender];
require(claimBal > 0, "NCT");
```
The function checks if the vault has started and if the user has a claim balance, but it does not check if the user has already claimed their premium.
```solidity
fixedClaimToken[msg.sender] = 0;
fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply -= claimBal;
```
The claim tokens are burned after claiming, but this does not prevent the function from being called again before the tokens are burned.

Exploit by Malicious Users:
A malicious user could repeatedly call `claimFixedPremium` before the claim tokens are effectively burned or the state is updated, allowing them to claim the premium multiple times.

## Impact
- The vault could suffer significant financial losses as malicious users drain the premium pool.
- Honest users may receive less than their fair share of the premium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to track whether a user has already claimed their premium and prevent multiple claims.
```diff
  // Add a mapping to track if a user has claimed their premium
+ mapping(address => bool) public hasClaimedPremium;

function claimFixedPremium() external {
    require(isStarted(), "CBS");
+   require(!hasClaimedPremium[msg.sender], "Already claimed");

    uint256 claimBal = fixedClaimToken[msg.sender];
    require(claimBal > 0, "NCT");

    uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply);

    userToFixedUpfrontPremium[msg.sender] = sendAmount;

    fixedBearerToken[msg.sender] += claimBal;
    fixedBearerTokenTotalSupply += claimBal;

    fixedClaimToken[msg.sender] = 0;
    fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply -= claimBal;

    // Mark the premium as claimed
+   hasClaimedPremium[msg.sender] = true;

    (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: sendAmount}("");
    require(sent, "ETF");
    emit FixedPremiumClaimed(sendAmount, claimBal, msg.sender);
}
```
