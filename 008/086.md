# Fixed participants can claim more premium than expected

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimFixedPremium()` is called to allow fixed participants to claim their fixed premium when vault is started. And `sendAmount`, the premium amount to be claimed, is determined by the participant's share of `variableSideCapacity`, using their balance of `fixedClaimTokens` over`fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply`.

```javascript
    // Check and cache balance for gas savings
    uint256 claimBal = fixedClaimToken[msg.sender];
    require(claimBal > 0, "NCT");

    // Send a proportional share of the total variable side deposits (premium) to the fixed side depositor
    uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply);
```
However `fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply` is the fixed bearer tokens and the variable side premium payment both.https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L77

it will be reduced when fixed participants performs on-going vault withdrawals due to the fact that the participant's balance of fixedBearerToken will be burned.

This will cause an issue with the `sendAmount` calculation within `claimFixedPremium()`, giving a higher than expected share of the `variableSideCapacity` after vault withdrawal by fixed participants. This allows fixed participants to claim more premium than allowed by doing it after certain amount of withdrawals.

## Impact
Fixed participants will claim more premium than expected.

## Recommendation

In claimFixedPremium(), use `fixedSideCapacity` instead of `fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply` as follows: 

```diff

-  uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply);
+  uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedSideCapacity);
```
