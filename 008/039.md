# incorrect handling of claimFixedPremium

High

Summary
The claimFixedPremium() function in the LidoVault contract calculates a premium based on variable side deposits but doesn't actually transfer funds from this specific source, potentially leading to mismanagement of funds and contract insolvency.

Vulnerability Detail
The function calculates sendAmount based on variable side capacity, implying it should be paid from variable side deposits. However, the actual transfer is made from the contract's general balance without explicitly sourcing from variable side funds.

Impact
The contract may pay out premiums using funds not intended for this purpose.
This could lead to a mismatch between expected and actual balances, potentially causing different balances which breaks the functionality of the protocol.

Code Snippet
```solidity
function claimFixedPremium() external {
  // ... [previous code omitted for brevity]

  uint256 sendAmount = claimBal.mulDiv(variableSideCapacity, fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply);  

  // ... [middle code omitted for brevity]

  (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: sendAmount}("");
  require(sent, "ETF");
  emit FixedPremiumClaimed(sendAmount, claimBal, msg.sender);
}
```

Tool used
Manual Review

Recommendation
There could be many fixes, one is to implement a new dedicated variable to track variable side deposits:
```solidity
uint256 public availableVariableDeposits;
```
Another is to be sure the sendAmount is coming always from total variable side deposits.
