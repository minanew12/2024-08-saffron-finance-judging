# Withdrawal Function Reverts on Variable Side Withdrawal, after vault started, Due to Uninitialized variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares Mapping

### Summary

When users attempt to withdraw their earnings from the variable side after the vault has started, the transaction reverts. This happens because the variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] mapping is always initialized to 0 when the contract first tries to access or modify it. As a result, the function attempts to perform calculations(division) using 0, causing the function to revert. 
the function becomes like this => 0.mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes).

### Root Cause

The mapping variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] is always initialized to 0. When the contract attempts to calculate the withdrawal amount using the formula:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L528

and the variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] is not set before, the contract tries to set the value after this calculation but the function always reverts.

### Internal pre-conditions

The vault has already started.

### External pre-conditions

Users must have staked funds in the variable side.

### Attack Path

The user can't withdraw after the vault has started.

### Impact

Users are unable to withdraw their earnings from the variable side once the vault has started, as the contract always reverts.
This affects the functionality of withdrawals, particularly in live environments where users expect to withdraw their staked funds after the vault has started.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before performing calculations on variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender], ensure the mapping is initialized correctly or add logic to handle cases where it has not been previously set.
