# The incorrect use of calldata

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Using `calldata` for function return values is not allowed in Solidity. The calldata keyword is specifically intended for input parameters in external functions to optimize gas usage when dealing with read-only data passed from outside the contract. However, return values must reside in memory or storage because they often need to be modified, and calldata is immutable.

Return values must typically reside in `memory` or `storage`, as they need to be stored temporarily (in memory) or persistently (in storage).

## Impact

Attempting to use `calldata` for return types will result in a compilation error.
