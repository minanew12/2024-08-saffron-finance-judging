# 0xesbee - Incorrect Return Value in getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds and getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds Functions

## Summary
Severity: Medium

The `getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds` and `getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds` functions is intended to return an array of uint256 withdrawal request IDs for a specific user. However, due to the underlying structure of the contract, the functions currently return the entire `WithdrawalRequest` struct instead of the requestIds array.

The struct `WithdrawalRequest` contains both `timestamp` and `requestIds`, but only the `requestIds` field is relevant for this functionâ€™s intended purpose.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions currently return the entire struct:
```
function getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
}
```
```
 function getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
  }
```
This is incorrect because `fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[user]` and `variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user]` is a `WithdrawalRequest` struct, and the function should return only the `requestIds` field from the struct.

## Impact
### **Incorrect Functionality:** 
If deployed, the functions would provide unexpected output to users or other contracts interacting with it. Instead of returning the withdrawal request IDs, it would return the entire `WithdrawalRequest` object, which could cause failure in dApps or external contracts that expect an array of IDs.
### **Type Mismatch / Compiler Error:** 
The declared return type of the function is uint256[], but the functions is returning a `WithdrawalRequest` struct, which includes both a `timestamp` and `requestIds`. This would likely result in a Solidity compiler error or runtime issues if the code were deployed without this fix.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, modify the functions to return only the requestIds field of the `WithdrawalRequest` struct. This ensures that the functions return an array of uint256 values as expected.

The corrected functions should be as follow:
```
function getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[user].requestIds;
}
```
```
 function getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
  }
```
