# Fixed side depositors won't be eligible for referral rewards for depositing ETH

### Summary

When fixed side depositors deposits some amount of `Ether` to the vault, it deposits to the `Lido`. However, it sets its referral address as `address(0)`. As a result, they can't receive referral rewards for depositing ETH.

### Root Cause

When fixed side depositors deposits some amount of `Ether` to the vault, it deposits to the `Lido`.
At [LidoVault.sol#L351](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L423), it deposits `Ether` to the `Lido`. However, it sets a referral address as `address(0)`

```solidity
File: lido-fiv\contracts\LidoVault.sol
328:   function deposit(uint256 side) external payable {
           [...]
351:       uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
```
The `Lido` protocol allows caller to pass referral argument when depositing ETH, and referral account can be eligible for referral rewards if it is valid.

The `_referral` parameter indicates the referral account which will be eligible for referral rewards.
If a fixed depositor is eligible for referral rewards, he can't receive any rewards.

### Mitigation

Use the address of a caller as referral instead `address(0)`.
```diff
-       uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
+       uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(msg.sender);
```
