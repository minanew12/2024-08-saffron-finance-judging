# When duration has ended, an attempt by a variable type depositor to request Withdrawals for staked earnings from the vault attempts to call `Lido::requestWithdrawals` and this fails

### Details 
```
 function withdraw(uint256 side) external {
    require(side == FIXED || side == VARIABLE, "IS");
    if (!isStarted()) {}
    else if (!isEnded()) {}
    else {
      return vaultEndedWithdraw(side);
    }
  }
```
In a situation where a vault duration has ended, and a variable type depositor tries to withdraw his staked earnings through `LidoVault::withdraw`, this calls fails because it attempts to call the internal function `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw` which is structured to request withdrawals from Lido. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L709C2-L728C6 (line 722) is what specifically tries to requestwithdrawal. Expectations are that variable depositors would be able to withdraw their staked interest based on the vault lifespan and even after the vault lifespan. `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw` is also expected to first check the type of fill before attempting to make a request and a variable fill is not expected to send any withdrawal reques to Lido.

### Impact
Loss of Staked earnings by Variable depositor after deposit has ended.

    function test_POC() external {

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        vault.deposit{value: 940 ether}(0);
        vault.deposit{value: 15 ether}(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        vault.deposit{value: 60 ether}(0);
        vault.deposit{value: 15 ether}(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(1000 + 3 weeks + 1);
        console.log(vault.isEnded());

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        vm.expectRevert();
        vault.withdraw(1);
        vm.stopPrank();
    } 
}
```

Comment out `vm.expectRevert();` and run `forge test -vvvv --fork-url ...(add your api)` to see the log mssg

### Recommendation
`LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw` sould protize the fille type first before making any request.
