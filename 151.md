# Lack of Validation on `earlyExitFeeBps`

## Summary
The `VaultFactory` contract allows the owner to set the `earlyExitFeeBps` without any validation. This enables the owner to assign arbitrary and malicious fee values, which can result in users being overcharged or losing their entire withdrawal amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `VaultFactory` contract, the `setEarlyExitFeeBps` function permits the owner to set the `earlyExitFeeBps` without any constraints:

    function setEarlyExitFeeBps(uint256 _earlyExitFeeBps) external onlyOwner {
        earlyExitFeeBps = _earlyExitFeeBps;
        // ...
    }

The function does not validate the value of `_earlyExitFeeBps` before setting it. The owner can set it to any value, including excessively high or low values.

High `earlyExitFeeBps` can result in users being overcharged during withdrawals. Users might lose a significant portion or all of their withdrawal amounts.

## Impact
The lack of validation on `earlyExitFeeBps` allows the contract owner to set arbitrary fee values, leading to users being overcharged or losing their entire withdrawal amounts.

## Recommendation
