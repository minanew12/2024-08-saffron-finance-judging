# Inaccurate Withdrawal Calculations Due to Staking Balance Fluctuations

## Summary
The `finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals` function in the `LidoVault` contract is vulnerable to inaccurate withdrawal calculations due to its reliance on the current staking balance. Fluctuations in the staking balance can lead to incorrect distribution of funds, resulting in potential financial losses for users and the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the function's dependency on the current staking balance to calculate the amount to be withdrawn. If the staking balance changes between the time a withdrawal request is made and when it is finalized, the calculations not accurately reflect the user's entitled amount.
```solidity
610:   function finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals() external {
611:@=>  uint256[] memory requestIds = variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
612:     if(variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] != 0) {
613:       withdrawAmountVariablePending();
614:       if(requestIds.length == 0) {
615:         return;
616:       }
617:     }
618:@=>  require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");
---
620:     delete variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
---
622:@=>  uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
---
624:     uint256 protocolFee = applyProtocolFee(amountWithdrawn);
---
626:     uint256 sendAmount = amountWithdrawn + calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare() - protocolFee;
---
628:     bool _isEnded = isEnded();
629:     transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);
---
631:     emit LidoWithdrawalFinalized(msg.sender, requestIds, VARIABLE, true, _isEnded);
632:     emit VariableFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, true, _isEnded);
633:   }
```
```solidity
uint256[] memory requestIds = variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");
```
The function retrieves and deletes the user's withdrawal request IDs, assuming the staking balance has not changed.
```solidity
uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
```
The `claimWithdrawals` function calculates the amount to be withdrawn based on the current staking balance, which may have changed since the withdrawal request was made.

## Impact
- Users receive more or less than their fair share.
- The vault or users may incur financial losses due to incorrect calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement a snapshot mechanism to record the staking balance at the time of the withdrawal request. Use this snapshot for calculations to ensure consistency.
- Introduce a buffer or margin in calculations to account for potential fluctuations in the staking balance.
```diff
+ mapping(address => uint256) public stakingBalanceSnapshots;

+ function requestWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external {
    // Take a snapshot of the staking balance when a withdrawal is requested
+   stakingBalanceSnapshots[msg.sender] = stakingBalance();
    // Proceed with withdrawal request logic
}

function finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals() external {
    uint256[] memory requestIds = variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
-   if(variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] != 0) {
-     withdrawAmountVariablePending();
-     if(requestIds.length == 0) {
-       return;
      }
    }
    require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");

    delete variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];

    // Use the snapshot for calculations
+   uint256 snapshotBalance = stakingBalanceSnapshots[msg.sender];
    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds, snapshotBalance);

    uint256 protocolFee = applyProtocolFee(amountWithdrawn);

    uint256 sendAmount = amountWithdrawn + calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare() - protocolFee;

-   bool _isEnded = isEnded();
    transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);

-   emit LidoWithdrawalFinalized(msg.sender, requestIds, VARIABLE, true, _isEnded);
-   emit VariableFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, true, _isEnded);

    // Clear the snapshot after the withdrawal is finalized
+   delete stakingBalanceSnapshots[msg.sender];
}
