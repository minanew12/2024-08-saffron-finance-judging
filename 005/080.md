# Potential DoS due to non-shrinking array usage in an unbounded loop

## Summary

When a vault is started, users that have made a deposit in it have the ability to `withdraw()` which will start a withdrawal process and add their address to the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array.

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L503>

```solidity
fixedBearerToken[msg.sender] = 0;
fixedBearerTokenTotalSupply -= bearerBalance;
fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity -= withdrawAmount;
fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender] = WithdrawalRequest({
  requestIds: requestWithdrawViaETH(msg.sender, withdrawAmount),
  timestamp: block.timestamp
});
@> fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.push(msg.sender);
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The array `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` in `LidoVault` is subjected to grow in size indefinitely in case multiple user attempt to `withdraw()` while the vault is ongoing.

When the withdrawal can be finalized, users call `finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals()` which will loop through every entry of the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array before `delete` the entry.

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L601>

```solidity
function finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals() external {
  uint256 sendAmount = claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(msg.sender);
  bool _isEnded = isEnded();
  uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
  for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == msg.sender) {
@>      delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
    }
  }
  transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);

  emit FixedFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, true, _isEnded);
}
```

Since the entries are only `deleted`, the array size remains the same. This only resets the value of the entry to `address(0)`.

## Impact

The functions that loop through the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array are subjected to Denial Of Service :
- `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals()`
- `finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals()`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array by a mapping or add another variable responsible for tracking the entry of the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array that belongs to a particular user.
