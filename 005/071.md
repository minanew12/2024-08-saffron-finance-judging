# [M-1]Unbounded Array Growth Leading to High Gas Consumption and Potential DoS Attack Risk

## Summary
An issue in the LidoVault contract allows the fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers array to grow without limits. This causes higher gas costs during operations, especially when looping through the array. If abused, it can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
The array fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers grows in size, but deleted elements are not removed efficiently. As a result, when looping through this array (e.g., in finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals()), the array length increases over time. This can lead to high gas usage. Additionally, an attacker can inflate the array by making many small deposits, increasing gas consumption and causing potential transaction failures for other users.
## Impact
High Gas Costs: As the array grows, later users will pay more gas to complete their transactions.
DoS Attack Risk: A malicious user can fill the array with small deposits, making it harder for others to withdraw funds due to gas limits.
## Code Snippet
[(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L601)]
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == msg.sender) {
        delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i]; // Deletes but doesn't shrink array
    }
}
```
###The code segments that would be affected due to the aforementioned code are as follows:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L601]
```solidity
  function finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals() external {
    uint256 sendAmount = claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(msg.sender);
    bool _isEnded = isEnded();
    uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
    for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
      if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == msg.sender) {
        delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
      }
    }
    transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);

    emit FixedFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, true, _isEnded);
  }
```
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L1168]
```solidity
  function _claimWithdrawals(address user, uint256[] memory requestIds) internal returns (uint256) {
    unlockReceive = true;
    uint256 beforeBalance = address(this).balance;

    // Claim Ether for the burned stETH positions
    // this will fail if the request is not finalized
    for (uint i = 0; i < requestIds.length; i++) {
      lidoWithdrawalQueue.claimWithdrawal(requestIds[i]);
    }

    uint256 withdrawnAmount = address(this).balance - beforeBalance;
    require(withdrawnAmount > 0, "IWA");

    emit WithdrawalClaimed(withdrawnAmount, requestIds, user);

    unlockReceive = false;
    return withdrawnAmount;
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Array Compression: Replace the deleted element with the last one and reduce the array size:

solidity
```solidity
fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[arrayLength - 1];
fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.pop();
```
Batch Processing: Process the array in smaller batches to avoid gas limit issues.

Array Limit: Set a maximum length for the array to prevent excessive growth.
