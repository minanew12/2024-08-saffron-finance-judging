# Inefficient way to delete in the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array with the `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals` function

### Summary

The `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals` function deletes elements from the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array within the loop by setting them to the zero address. This does not actually remove the element, leading to inefficiencies and potential issues if the array is used elsewhere.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the inefficient deletion in the loop within the `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals` function stems from how elements are "deleted" from the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

#### Setting Elements to Zero:

* Approach: The function sets elements of the array to the zero address (or equivalent) to indicate they are "deleted."
* Problem: This approach does not actually remove the element from the array; it only nullifies its value. The array's length remains unchanged, and the zeroed elements still occupy space.

### Attack Path

The inefficient deletion in the loop can be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) situation by increasing the gas cost of operations that involve iterating over the array. Here's a potential attack path:

#### Identify the Vulnerability:
* An attacker identifies that the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array is not properly managed, with elements being set to zero rather than removed. This leads to inefficiencies in how the array is processed.

#### Trigger Array Growth:
* The attacker repeatedly triggers conditions that add entries to the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array. Even if these entries are later "deleted" by setting them to zero, they still occupy space in the array.

#### Increase Gas Costs:
* By artificially inflating the size of the array with zeroed-out entries, the attacker increases the gas cost of any function that iterates over the array. This includes the `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals` function and potentially other functions that interact with the array.

#### Denial of Service (DoS):
* The increased gas cost makes it prohibitively expensive for legitimate users to process withdrawals or perform other operations involving the array. If the gas cost exceeds the block gas limit, transactions will fail, effectively creating a DoS situation.

#### Sustain the Attack:
* The attacker can sustain the attack by continuously adding entries to the array, ensuring that the gas cost remains high and the DoS condition persists

### Impact

The inefficient deletion in the loop within the `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals` function can lead to several issues. Here's a detailed explanation:

#### State Bloat:
* Impact: The array retains its length even if elements are set to zero, leading to unnecessary state bloat. This can make the contract more expensive to interact with and maintain.

#### Logical Errors:
* Impact: Future logic that relies on the array's length or contents might behave unexpectedly, as the array still contains zeroed-out elements.

#### Gas Inefficiency:
* Impact: Continuously iterating over a growing array with "deleted" elements (set to zero) can lead to increased gas costs. This inefficiency can make transactions more expensive and potentially exceed gas limits, causing them to fail.

### Mitigation

 Consider using a more efficient method to remove elements from an array, such as swapping the element with the last one and then popping the array.
