# Incorrect Handling of `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` Leads to Inconsistencies

## Summary
The `LidoVault` contract manages a dynamic array `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` to track users with ongoing fixed withdrawals. However, it uses the `delete` operation to remove users from this array, which sets the element to `address(0)` without removing it. This results in gaps within the array, leading to inconsistent state management and increased gas consumption during array iterations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals`, `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals`, `claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal` functions, the contract removes users from the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array by setting their address to `address(0)`. 

Example:

    function finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals() external {
	    // ...
	    uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
	    for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
	      if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == msg.sender) {
	        delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
	      }
	    }
	    // ...
    }

This is leaving gaps with `address(0)`. Using `delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];` sets the array element to `address(0)` without reducing the array's length. The array retains its original length, with `address(0)` occupying the spot of the deleted user.

As the array grows with `address(0)` entries, loops become more gas-intensive.

Extremely large arrays with numerous `address(0)` entries can cause critical functions to fail due to exceeding gas limits.

Proof of Concept:

    function poc() pure external {
        address[1] memory fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers = [
            0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
        ];

        uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
            if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890) {
                delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
            }
        }

        // Log the length and elements of the array
        console.log("Array Length:", arrayLength);
        console.log("Element 0:", fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[0]);
    }


## Impact
The improper handling of the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array leads to increased gas costs, out-of-gas errors, and inconsistent contract states. This can prevent users from successfully withdrawing their funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array with a mapping to track ongoing withdrawals, eliminating gaps and reducing gas consumption. If maintaining an array is necessary for enumeration, implement an efficient removal method, such as swapping the user with the last element and popping the array, to prevent `address(0)` entries and ensure consistent state management.
