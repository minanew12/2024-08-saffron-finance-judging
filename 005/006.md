# Incomplete Withdrawal Handling in LidoVault

## Summary
The `LidoVault` contract has several functions for handling withdrawals that lack mechanisms for ensuring timely execution and handling failures. This can lead to potential data loss and user dissatisfaction due to inaccessible funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. `finalizeVaultNotStartedFixedWithdrawals`
Issue: Data loss if not called before the vault starts.
```solidity
577:   function finalizeVaultNotStartedFixedWithdrawals() external {
578:@=>  uint256[] memory requestIds = fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
579:@=>  require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");
---
581:     delete fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
---
584:     uint256 sendAmount = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
---
586:     bool _isStarted = isStarted();
587:     bool _isEnded = isEnded();
588:     transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);
---
590:     emit LidoWithdrawalFinalized(msg.sender, requestIds, FIXED, _isStarted, _isEnded);
591:     emit FixedFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, _isStarted, _isEnded);
592:   }
```
This function relies on manual invocation before the vault starts. If not called, users may lose the opportunity to withdraw funds before the vault transitions to the "started" state.

2. `finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals`
Issue: No mechanism to handle failed withdrawals.
```solidity
595:   function finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals() external {
596:@=>  uint256 sendAmount = claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(msg.sender);
597:     bool _isEnded = isEnded();
598:     uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
599:     for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
600:       if (fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i] == msg.sender) {
601:         delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
602:       }
603:     }
604:@=>  transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);
---
606:     emit FixedFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, true, _isEnded);
607:   }
```
If a withdrawal fails due to technical issues, there is no retry mechanism or error handling to address the failure.

3. `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals`
Issue: Data loss if not called timely; no mechanism for handling failed withdrawals.
```solidity
690:   function claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals() internal {
691:@=>  uint256 arrayLength = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers.length;
692:     for (uint i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
693:       address fixedUser = fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
694:       fixedToPendingWithdrawalAmount[fixedUser] = claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(fixedUser);
695:       delete fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers[i];
696:     }
697:   }
```
This function must be called in a timely manner to ensure users can claim their withdrawals. Additionally, it lacks error handling for failed claims.

## Impact
Users may lose access to their funds if functions are not called at the right time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Introduce retry logic for handling failed withdrawals to ensure users can eventually access their funds.
- Use automated scripts or smart contract logic to ensure critical functions are called at the appropriate times.
- Implement error handling to manage and log failures, providing feedback to users and allowing for corrective actions.
- Develop a notification system to inform users of their withdrawal status, especially if there are delays or issues.
