# There is an issue with the management of the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals` function, the current approach involves iterating over the `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` array and using the `delete` operator to remove user addresses. However, this method only sets the respective array elements to their default value (`address(0)`) without shrinking the array length.

## Impact

Array bloating: Over time, the array will accumulate many `address(0)` elements, increasing the gas cost for subsequent operations.

Logical confusion: Handling arrays with `address(0)` elements may cause unexpected behavior or errors during iteration or validation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To manage the array more efficiently, use a technique that maintains array compactness. One effective method is to swap the element to be deleted with the last element of the array, and then use the `pop` function to remove the last element. This reduces gas consumption and keeps the array compact.
Use mappings instead of arrays.Since reading from a mapping has constant time complexity (O(1)), it can avoid traversing the entire array.
