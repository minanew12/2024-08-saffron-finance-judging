# Improper Transfer Check Leading to Potential Loss of Funds in the  `withdrawAmountVariablePending()` function

### Summary

Setting the pending withdrawal amount to zero in `withdrawAmountVariablePending()` before executing the transfer can cause a permanent loss of funds for users, as any interruption in the transaction (rejection during signing, gas issues) will clear the user’s balance without transferring the funds.


### Root Cause

In the `withdrawAmountVariablePending()` function, the choice to set the user's pending withdrawal amount to zero before executing the transfer is a mistake, as it results in the loss of funds if the transfer fails. This design flaw causes users’ balances to be reset even if the funds are not successfully transferred, leading to irreversible financial loss.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user needs to have a non-zero balance in `variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender]`.
2. The contract must have enough ETH to cover the pending withdrawal amount for the user.
3. The user must call the `withdrawAmountVariablePending()` function to initiate the withdrawal process.

### External pre-conditions

1. The user interrupts the transaction, such as rejecting the signing request in their wallet.
2. The transaction runs out of gas during execution, causing it to fail.
3. Network issues or other unforeseen errors cause the transfer operation to fail, leading to incomplete execution of the transaction.

### Attack Path

1. The user calls the `withdrawAmountVariablePending()` function to withdraw their pending balance.
2. The function retrieves the pending amount and sets the user's balance to zero in the contract.
3. An external disruption occurs (e.g., the user rejects the signing request, runs out of gas, or a network error happens).
4. The transfer fails, but the pending amount remains zero, resulting in a permanent loss of the user’s funds without transferring them.

### Impact

1.**Loss of Funds**: The user can lose all their balance if the transfer fails. This is particularly critical in environments where contracts may fail unexpectedly due to gas issues or malicious actors.
2.**Denial of Service (DoS)**: A malicious actor could craft a contract to exploit this issue, causing repeated transfer failures, effectively locking user funds permanently.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The function should first set the user’s pending balance to zero, then attempt the transfer using call. If the transfer fails, the pending balance should be restored, and the transaction should revert. This approach ensures that user funds are protected from permanent loss due to transfer failures while maintaining security against reentrancy attacks, making the function more robust and reliable in handling external disruptions.

```solidity
function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No amount to withdraw");

    // Set balance to zero first
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;

    // Attempt the transfer
    (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
    
    // If transfer fails, revert the balance
    if (!success) {
        variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = amount;
        revert("Transfer failed");
    }
}
