# Send ether with call instead of transfer

## Summary
Use call instead of transfer to send ether. And return value must be checked if sending ether is successful or not. Sending ether with the transfer is no longer recommended.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
  @>>  payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
  }
