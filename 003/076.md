# some smart contract vault users will not be able to withdraw

## Summary
Some smart contract vault users will not be able to withdraw
## Vulnerability Detail

When withdrawing ETH from the saffron's vault, `transfer()` is used, instead of `call{}()`. However in case the `msg.sender` is a smart contract, it's fallback or receive function might cost more than `2300 gas(transfer's max gas cost)`. This will lead to withdraw failures and stuck ETH in the vault

```solidity
  /// @notice withdrawal of funds for Variable side
  function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);    <@
  }
```

Affected functions: `LidoVault::withdrawAmountVariablePending()` and `LidoVault::finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals()`

## Impact
Smart contracts with custom fallback/receive functions will revert and not receive the withdrawals. Stuck funds in the vault

## Recommendation
Use `call `instead of `transfer `for transferring ETH. Protect from reentrancy possibilities if needed, after this change.
