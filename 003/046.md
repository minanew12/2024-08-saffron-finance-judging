# LidoVault contract has Unauthorised Access to withdrawAmountVariablePending function Allows Malicious Withdrawals

# Sherlock.xyz Security Audit Findings

### Title: Unauthorized Access to `withdrawAmountVariablePending` Allows Malicious Withdrawals

### Project: LidoVault Contract
### Date: September 2024
### Audited by: fat32

### Location:
- [LidoVault.sol: L653-L657](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L653-L657)

### Vulnerability Summary:

The function `withdrawAmountVariablePending` in the `LidoVault` contract allows any caller to withdraw the pending variable amount for any user. This is because it does not enforce proper access control, leading to a potential loss of funds for users. The function should be restricted to allow only the specific user (or an authorized party) to withdraw their pending funds.

### Impact:

A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to withdraw the entire pending variable amount of any user, resulting in significant loss of user funds. The attacker does not need to hold any special privileges, making this vulnerability critical.

### Severity: **High**

- **Type**: Access Control
- **Impact**: Unauthorized fund withdrawal
- **Likelihood**: High (due to the ease of exploitation)

### Vulnerable Code:
```solidity
function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

### Proof of Concept (POC):

The following Foundry test demonstrates how an unauthorized user can exploit the vulnerability to withdraw funds:
```txt
lido-fiv/test/LidoVaultAccessControl.t.sol
```
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {LidoVault} from "../contracts/LidoVault.sol";

contract LidoVaultAccessControlTest is Test {
    LidoVault public lidovault;
    function setUp() public {
        lidovault = new LidoVault(bool(true));
    }

    function testAccess0() external {
        uint256 side = 1;
        address user = address(0xbEEF);
        address msgSender = address(0xbEEF);
        vm.startPrank(msgSender);
        lidovault.withdrawAmountVariablePending();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

}
```

```

### Mitigation:

To prevent unauthorized access, add proper access control to restrict withdrawals to only the user who owns the pending variable amount. This can be done by using `msg.sender` in conjunction with the withdrawal amount mapping.

Here’s the recommended fix:

#### Solidity Mitigation:
```solidity
function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No pending withdrawal amount");
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

### Conclusion:

This vulnerability is critical as it allows any user to withdraw another user's pending variable amount without restriction. Applying access control and ensuring that only the appropriate user can withdraw their funds mitigates this issue.
