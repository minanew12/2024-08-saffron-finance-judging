# OOG due to transfer

## Summary
In `LidoVault::withdrawAmountVariablePending` `transfer()` is used for transferring ether to the msg.sender. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As we know `transfer()` sends 2300 gas meaning that a more sophisticated wallet may not be able to receive such a transfer. Such wallet will have to be a smart contract wallet which is using the SLOAD opcode for example. In the mentioned cases all withdrawals will revert due to OOG errors and the ether will be locked in the `LidoVault` contract.

## Impact
This issue will lead to some users not being able to withdraw.
Example of wallets that will have such a problem:
1. Gnosis Safe (Safe Wallet)
2. Argent Wallet
3. Authereum
4. Loopring Wallet

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
	uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
	variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
	payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue just change the call from `.transfer()` to `.call()` which does not have a gas cap.
