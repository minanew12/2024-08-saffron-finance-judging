# Using `transfer` to send ETH is preventing contract users from making withdrawals.


## Summary

Using `transfer` to send ETH in the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function can lead to issues, as transfer can only send ETH to individuals, not contracts. This may cause the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function to always revert when a user tries to withdraw after vault started.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since there are no restrictions preventing contract users from making deposits, users can deposit ETH into the variable side of the vault using the deposit function. the contract users can use `withdraw` function after the vault started and some request ids generated in `variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds`. So far, everything has been functioning well. However, users cant finalize the withdraw process with `finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals` function becuase of using `transfer` instead of `call`.

## Impact

contact users are unable to withdraw after vault started and before ended and lose eth.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of using `transfer` protocol can simply use `call` :

```diff
  function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
-    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
+    (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
+    require(sent, "ETF");
  }
```
