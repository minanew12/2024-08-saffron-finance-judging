# Lack of error handling within the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function

### Summary

The `transfer` function invoked in the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function does not have any error handling mechanisms which means we need to include that in our code. Failure to do so may cause unexpected function behaviour, more so when `withdrawAmountVariablePending` is invoked in other functions that may depend on it (such as the `finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals function`)

### Root Cause

As seen in the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L656

there's is no error handling taking place after transfering an amount to the receipient.

### Attack Path

Here's how the attack path would potentially look like:

#### Identify Vulnerable Function:
The attacker identifies that the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function lacks proper error handling.

#### Deploy a Malicious Contract:
The attacker deploys a contract with a fallback function or a receive function designed to exploit the lack of error handling. This function could consume all gas or revert the transaction when receiving Ether.

#### Trigger the Vulnerable Function:
The attacker calls the `withdrawAmountVariablePending` function from their malicious contract, attempting to withdraw pending Ether.
#### Exploit the Transfer:
When the contract attempts to transfer Ether to the attacker's contract, the fallback or receive function is triggered, causing the transfer to fail.
Without proper error handling, the function might incorrectly update the state, assuming the transfer was successful.

### Impact

Here's a couple of possible scenarios with regards to the impact of a lack of error handling mechanism:

#### Failed Transfers:
* Issue: If the ETH transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient gas, network issues, or an issue with the recipient address), the function does not handle this failure, potentially leaving the user without their funds.
* Impact: Users may not receive their pending withdrawals, leading to dissatisfaction and potential financial loss.

#### State Inconsistency:

* Issue: Without error handling, the function might not revert the state changes if the transfer fails, leading to inconsistencies. For example, the pending amount could be set to zero even though the transfer did not succeed.
* Impact: This could result in users being unable to access their funds, as the contract believes the transfer was successful.

### Mitigation

Make the following changes to your code:
```diff
function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
-    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
+ (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
+ require(success, "Transfer failed")
  }
```
