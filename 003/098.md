# Pending withdraw amounts cannot be claimed by inadequate smart contract

Lines of code: 
## Vulnerability details
The use of `transfer()` function for an address will make the transaction fail when the claimer is:
- Smart contract without a payable function.
- Smart contract without a fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
- Smart contract with correct fallback but called through proxy, raising the gas usage above 2300.
- Multisig with +2300 gas.

## Impact
Smart contracts with one of the conditions above calling their variable side pending withdraws (`withdrawAmountVariablePending`) will have their transaction revert, having their pending funds locked funds in the contract.
```js
  /// @notice withdrawal of funds for Variable side
  function withdrawAmountVariablePending() public {
    uint256 amount = variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender];
    variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
@>    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
  }
```

Another issue caused by the same root is when calling `finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals`:
```js
 function finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals() external {
    uint256[] memory requestIds = variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
    if(variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] != 0) {
@>      withdrawAmountVariablePending();
      if(requestIds.length == 0) {
        return;
      }
    }
...
```
When it first checks if the user has pending variable withdraws, causing the transaction to fail, not following up with the function logic.
