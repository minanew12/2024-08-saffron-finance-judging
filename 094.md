# Potential Vulnerability in `Early Exit Fee` Calculation

## Summary
The early exit fee mechanism in the LidoVault contract may allow fixed side users to withdraw without paying a sufficient penalty as the fee decreases over time. This could result in a loss of yield for variable side users, contradicting the protocol's intended compensation structure.
## Vulnerability Detail
The early exit fee is designed to decrease over time, incentivizing fixed side users to remain in the vault until its end. However, if the fee is set to a very low initial value i.e just above 0 enough to pass this check ` require(params.earlyExitFeeBps != 0, "NEI");`,   it can quickly decrease to zero, especially if the vault duration is long or if the fee calculation does not enforce a minimum threshold. This allows fixed users to withdraw without penalty, leading to reduced compensation for variable users who rely on these fees to offset their diminished yield.
## Impact
Fixed users can potentially withdraw without paying a penalty, leading to a loss of yield for variable users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a Minimum Fee Threshold: Introduce a minimum early exit fee to ensure that the fee does not decrease to zero before the vault ends. This threshold should be sufficient to compensate variable users adequately.
