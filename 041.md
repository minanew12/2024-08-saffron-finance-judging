# Some functions can revert if the LidoWithDrawalQueueERC721 is updated

### Summary

As the variable MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT cannot be updated and the Lido MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT in the LidoWithdrawalQueueERC721 can be updated (since LidoWithdrawalQueueERC721 is a proxy), the withdraw function will revert if the staked amount exceeds the new Lido MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT value.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L1015

The LidoWithdrawalQueue contract reverts if the withdrawal amount is greater than the MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT defined in the same contract.

function _checkWithdrawalRequestAmount(uint256 _amountOfStETH) internal pure {
    if (_amountOfStETH < MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT) {
        revert RequestAmountTooSmall(_amountOfStETH);
    }
    if (_amountOfStETH > MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT) {
        revert RequestAmountTooLarge(_amountOfStETH);
    }
}

As the LidoWithdrawalQueue is a proxy, we can assume the likelihood of constants like MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT being updated, even if it's very low.

Since the variable MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT in the LidoVault cannot be modified, if the value of MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT from LidoVault is greater than the new MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT from LidoWithdrawalQueue, each call to the function calculateWithdrawals will revert.

The external function withdraw indirectly calls this function under certain conditions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Staked amount superior to the new MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT

### External pre-conditions

1. Update of the Lido WithDrawableQueue contract to modify the value of the constant MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT

### Attack Path
This is a bug that will occur when Lido updates its protocol, and Lido is not trusted in this context. Moreover, they have no interest in verifying if a change on their end could break the protocols that use Lido in this manner.

### Impact

Medium. Low Likehood, High Impact . Loss of funds. Users will not be capable of withdrawing their funds. 

### PoC

None. 

### Mitigation

Add a setter to the variable MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT
