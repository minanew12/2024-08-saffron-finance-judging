# {function is called multiple times within withdraw function} which will {increase gas costs} {for users}

### Summary

Repeated function calls inside `LidoVault.withdraw()`contract, loops will cause increased gas costs for users as the contract repeatedly accesses values without caching, leading to inefficient execution.

### Root Cause

in LidoVault.sol line 423-556

The choice to perform repeated function calls within loops and conditional blocks without caching their states is a mistake as it significantly increases gas costs. Instead of retrieving the same value multiple times, caching results in local variables would reduce the gas usage, making the contract more efficient.

The function calls such as `isStarted()` and `isEnded()` are already being cached. However `stakingBalance()` , `stakingShares()` , and `minStETHWithdrawalAmount()` are not cached. They are making repeated function calls accross many functions in the contract to access this information.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **The contract design uses function calls within loops and conditional blocks**: The functions like stakingBalance(), stakingShares(), and minStETHWithdrawalAmount() are called multiple times within a single execution of the withdraw() function, especially inside loops and conditionals.

2. **The function results are not cached locally within the execution flow**: Despite being called multiple times, the values are not stored in local variables outside of the loop or conditional structures, leading to repeated gas costs for retrieving the same data.

3.**No existing mechanism to update cached values efficiently**: The contract does not employ an efficient method to update or manage cached values, resulting in unnecessary function calls during each execution.


### External pre-conditions

1. **External protocols (e.g., staking platforms) frequently update relevant values** like staking balances or share amounts, necessitating function calls that should ideally be cached to minimize gas costs.

2. **The contract relies on up-to-date values from external sources**, which might not be efficiently handled if these values are fetched repeatedly rather than cached.


### Attack Path

1. **User calls** `withdraw()`: The function is executed, triggering internal logic with loops and conditionals.

2. **Contract calls `stakingBalance()`, `stakingShares()`, and `minStETHWithdrawalAmount()` multiple times within the execution**: These calls are not cached, leading to redundant calculations and increased gas costs.

### Impact

The users suffer increased transaction costs due to inefficient gas usage. Each call to `withdraw()` incurs higher gas fees because of repeated function calls within loops and conditionals without caching, resulting in an unnecessary burden on the user.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Consider using state variables for values that need to be accessed across multiple functions:** This would involve updating these variables only when necessary, reducing repeated calls and improving overall gas efficiency.

**Implement an efficient update mechanism**: For cached values that need periodic updates, ensure that they are updated at the appropriate times without causing additional gas costs during every function call.
