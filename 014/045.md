# `finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals` allows anyone to steal fixed-side user funds

### Summary

The incorrect use of `msg.sender` in the [`claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L812-L844) will cause any user to receive the withdrawal funds of fixed-side users as the contract misroutes the ETH during the withdrawal finalization process.


### Root Cause

In [`LidoVault.sol`](https://github.com/saffron-finance/lido-fiv/blob/7246b6651c8affffe17faa4d2984975102a65d81/contracts/LidoVault.sol), the [`claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L812-L844) incorrectly [calls `claimWithdrawals` with `msg.sender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L831) instead of the intended `user`. This misroutes the ETH withdrawal to the caller of the function rather than the rightful fixed-side user.

**Affected Functions:**
- `finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals`
- `claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal`


### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Any user** needs to **call** `finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals` with `side == FIXED` after the vault has ended.
2. The `vaultEndedWithdrawalsFinalized` flag must be **false**.
3. There must be **pending fixed-side withdrawal requests** in `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers`.
4. The `fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds` mapping must contain **valid withdrawal requests** for the fixed-side users.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker** calls the [`finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L661-L688) with `side == FIXED` after the vault has ended.
2. Inside `finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals`, the function checks and sets `vaultEndedWithdrawalsFinalized` to `true`.
3. The function then calls `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals`, which iterates through `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers`.
4. For each `fixedUser`, `claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(fixedUser)` is invoked.
5. Inside `claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal`, the function erroneously calls:
    ```solidity
    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
    ```
    Instead of:
    ```solidity
    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(user, requestIds);
    ```
6. As a result, the ETH withdrawn from Lido is transferred to `msg.sender` (the attacker) instead of the intended `fixedUser`.
7. The attacker receives the ETH that should have been sent to the fixed-side users.
8. This process repeats for all `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers`, allowing the attacker to drain their funds.


### Impact

Fixed-side users suffer a **complete loss of their withdrawal funds**, resulting in significant financial losses. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the ETH intended for fixed-side users, undermining the protocol's integrity and leading to a **loss of user trust** and potential **reputation damage** for Saffron Finance.

### PoC

1. **User A** deposits **100 ETH** into the fixed side and plans to withdraw early.
2. **User A** initiates a withdrawal by calling:
    ```solidity
    vault.withdraw(FIXED);
    ```
3. The vault records the withdrawal request in `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` and `fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[UserA]`.
4. After the vault has ended, **Attacker** calls:
    ```solidity
    vault.finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals(FIXED);
    ```
5. Inside `finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals`, the function sets `vaultEndedWithdrawalsFinalized` to `true` and calls `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals`.
6. `claimOngoingFixedWithdrawals` iterates over `fixedOngoingWithdrawalUsers` and calls:
    ```solidity
    claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(UserA);
    ```
7. Inside `claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal`, the function incorrectly transfers the withdrawn ETH to `msg.sender` (the attacker) instead of `UserA`:
    ```solidity
    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
    ```
8. The attacker receives **100 ETH** intended for **User A**.

**Relevant Code Snippets:**

```solidity
function finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals() external {
    uint256 sendAmount = claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(msg.sender);
    // ...
}

function claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(address user) internal returns (uint256) {
    // ...
    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
    // ...
}
```

In the above code, `msg.sender` refers to the attacker calling `finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals`, resulting in ETH being sent to the attacker instead of the intended `user`.


### Mitigation

Ensure that the `claimWithdrawals` function is called with the correct `user` parameter instead of `msg.sender`. Update the `claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal` function to pass the `user` address.

```diff
function claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(address user) internal returns (uint256) {
    if (user == address(0)) return 0;

    WithdrawalRequest memory request = fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
    uint256[] memory requestIds = request.requestIds;
    require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");

    uint256 upfrontPremium = userToFixedUpfrontPremium[user];

    delete userToFixedUpfrontPremium[user];
    delete fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];

-   uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);
+   uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(user, requestIds);

    uint256 earlyExitFees = calculateFixedEarlyExitFees(upfrontPremium, request.timestamp);
    earlyExitFees = Math.min(earlyExitFees, amountWithdrawn);

    feeEarnings += earlyExitFees;

    emit LidoWithdrawalFinalized(user, requestIds, FIXED, true, isEnded());

    return amountWithdrawn - earlyExitFees;
}
```
