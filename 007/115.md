# LidoVault contract has Lack of Access Control on the getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds Function

# Sherlock.xyz Security Audit Findings Report

### Project: LidoVault Contract
### Date: September 2024
### Audited by: fat32

---

### Summary

During the audit of the `LidoVault` smart contract, a critical access control vulnerability was identified. The `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function is publicly accessible and lacks access control, allowing any external user to retrieve the withdrawal request IDs of any user. This exposes sensitive data and opens the possibility for malicious actors to obtain private information about other users' vault interactions, which could lead to more targeted or sophisticated attacks.

This audit report presents the vulnerability, a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the issue, suggested mitigations, and improvements.

## Lack of Access Control on the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds` Function

### **Severity**: High

### **Impact**

The `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function is vulnerable due to the absence of access control, enabling any external user to query the ongoing withdrawal request IDs for any user in the vault. This can lead to sensitive data exposure, including revealing other users' withdrawal patterns. An attacker can gather private information about vault users, which may expose them to more sophisticated attacks such as phishing or front-running based on known withdrawal patterns.

### **Vulnerable Code Location**
- **URL**: [Vulnerable Code on GitHub](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L146-L148)
```solidity
  function getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user].requestIds;
  }
```

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This PoC demonstrates how an unauthorized user can call the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function to retrieve the withdrawal request IDs of another user without permission.

```

This Foundry test logs confirm that the function can be called successfully by an unauthorized address (`0xBEEF`), indicating a lack of access control on the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function. The test passes, meaning that unauthorized users can retrieve sensitive information from the vault, potentially leading to exploitation.

### **Mitigation**

To prevent unauthorized access, restrict access to the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function by implementing an access control mechanism such as `onlyDepositor` or `onlyOwner`. This will ensure that only users with an active deposit or the contract owner can call the function.

Here’s a mitigation using a `modifier` to restrict access to legitimate depositors:

```solidity
// Access Control Modifier
modifier onlyDepositor() {
    require(fixedETHDepositToken[msg.sender] > 0 || variableBearerToken[msg.sender] > 0, "Not a depositor");
    _;
}

function getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view onlyDepositor returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user].requestIds;
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`onlyDepositor` modifier**: Ensures that only users who have made a deposit (either to the fixed or variable side) can access sensitive information like ongoing withdrawal request IDs.
- **Updated function**: The `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function now includes the `onlyDepositor` modifier to restrict access to depositors only, preventing unauthorized users from querying sensitive data.

This solution ensures that only legitimate users with deposits can access their withdrawal request IDs, preventing malicious actors from exploiting the function.

---

### Conclusion

#### Summary of Findings:
1. **Lack of Access Control on Sensitive Functions**: Unauthorized users can access sensitive information, such as ongoing withdrawal request IDs, through the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function.
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Type**: Access Control Vulnerability
   - **Mitigation**: Implement access control using the `onlyDepositor` modifier to restrict access to depositors.

By implementing the recommended access control mechanisms, the `LidoVault` contract will be more secure against unauthorized access to sensitive user information and will safeguard user data integrity.
