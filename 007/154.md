# LidoVault contract allows any user to access the withdrawal request IDs of any other user on getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds

### Security Audit Report for Saffron Finance Lido Vault Contract

### Auditor: fat32

#### Vulnerability Summary:
The function `getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds(address user)` allows any user to access the withdrawal request IDs of any other user. This introduces a potential privacy breach since an attacker can access sensitive withdrawal-related data for other users without permission. This issue is particularly concerning in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments, where such information should remain confidential and only accessible to authorized parties.

#### Vulnerability Details:
- **Impact**: Medium
  - **Privacy Breach**: Any user can call this function to view another user's withdrawal request IDs, which could leak sensitive transaction information or facilitate front-running strategies.
  - **Exploit Scenario**: An attacker can invoke this function and retrieve details of any user's pending withdrawal requests, gaining unauthorized visibility into user behavior.

#### Severity: **Medium**

#### Issue Type: **Access Control / Privacy Issue**

#### Vulnerable Code:
- **File**: [LidoVault.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L150-L152)
- **Location**: Line 150-152

```solidity
function getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    return fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
}
```

#### Proof of Concept (PoC) Test:
The following Foundry PoC test demonstrates how an unauthorized user can access withdrawal request IDs of another user:

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {LidoVault} from "../contracts/LidoVault.sol";

contract LidoVaultAccessControlTest is Test {
    LidoVault public lidovault;
    address public account;
    ILido public ilido;
    ILidoVault public ilidovault;
    ILidoWithdrawalQueueERC721 public ilidowithdrawal;
    ILidoVaultInitializer public ilidovaultinitializer;
    ILidoVaultInitializer.InitializationParams public initializationparams;

    // Mock Lido contract
    function setUp() public {
        account = address(this);
        uint256 newBalance = 100 ether;
        lidovault = new LidoVault(true); // Initializing LidoVault with a true parameter
        ilido = ILido(address(this)); // Deploying a mock Lido contract
        vm.deal(account, newBalance); // Deal ether to the test account
    }

    function testAccessController() external {
        uint256 amount = 1000;
        address attacker = address(0xbEEF);
        address user = address(1157920892373111111111111111111111111111111111111);
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        //lidovault.initialize(ILidoVaultInitializer.InitializationParams({ vaultId: type(uint256).max, duration: type(uint256).max, fixedSideCapacity: type(uint256).max, variableSideCapacity: type(uint256).max, earlyExitFeeBps: type(uint256).max, protocolFeeBps: type(uint256).max, protocolFeeReceiver: address(0xbEEF) }));
        lidovault.getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds(account);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

#### Foundry Log Results:
The test shows that an unauthorized address (attacker) can access the withdrawal request IDs of another user without any restriction. The test passed, indicating that no access control checks are implemented.

#### Recommended Mitigation:
Restrict access to the `getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds` function so that only the user who owns the withdrawal requests can view them. Implement an access control check to ensure that only authorized addresses (e.g., the user themselves) can access their own data.

**Solidity Mitigation Code**:
```solidity
function getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    require(msg.sender == user, "Access denied: Unauthorized access to withdrawal request IDs");
    return fixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
}
```

#### Steps to Mitigate:
1. **Add access control**: Introduce a `require` check to ensure only the owner of the withdrawal requests can access their own data.
2. **Re-deploy the contract**: Once the access control is added, the contract needs to be redeployed to the network.
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure that the fix is effective by rerunning the Foundry tests with both valid and invalid users attempting to access the function.

#### Severity Justification:
The severity is rated as **Medium** because the vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive user information, but it doesn't directly result in loss of funds. However, the leaked information can still be used to gain competitive advantage or track user behavior, which is significant in financial applications.

#### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `getFixedToVaultNotStartedWithdrawalRequestIds` lacks access control, resulting in a privacy breach. Applying the mitigation to restrict access to this function only to authorized users will resolve the issue and protect user data from unauthorized access.
