# LidoVault allows unauthorised actors to access sensitive data via getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp function

# Sherlock.xyz Security Audit Findings Report

### Project: LidoVault Contract
### Date: September 2024
### Audited by: fat32

---

### Summary

I identified access control vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized actors to access sensitive data. Specifically, the lack of access restrictions on the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp()` function could allow an attacker to retrieve information about other users' withdrawal requests. Without proper access control mechanisms, malicious users can exploit this flaw to access confidential information or potentially disrupt vault operations.

The audit findings detail the severity, impact, proof of concept (PoC), mitigation suggestions, and relevant code changes.

## Lack of Access Control on the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp` Function

### **Severity**: High

### **Impact**

The `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp()` function is publicly accessible, allowing any external address to query the ongoing withdrawal request timestamp of any user. This is a significant privacy concern, as unauthorized actors could obtain sensitive information about users' interactions with the vault.

If the system relies on such timestamps to track user interactions or withdrawals, exposing this information could lead to more sophisticated attacks, especially if combined with other vulnerabilities or user behavior patterns.

### **Vulnerable Code Location**
- Link: [Vulnerable Code on GitHub](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L142-L144)
```solidity
  function getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    return fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user].timestamp;
  }
```

#### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This PoC demonstrates how an unauthorized attacker can call the function to access a sensitive timestamp associated with another user.

```

The test simulates an unauthorized user (address `0xBEEF`) invoking the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp()` function to query sensitive information from the vault. The test passes, demonstrating that the function can be called without any restrictions.

### **Mitigation**

To prevent unauthorized access, restrict access to this function by implementing access control mechanisms such as `onlyDepositor` or `onlyOwner`. These restrictions will ensure that only users who have made deposits or other legitimate stakeholders can access this information.

Here’s a Solidity-based solution using the `onlyDepositor` modifier to restrict access:

```solidity
// Access Control Modifier
modifier onlyDepositor() {
    require(fixedETHDepositToken[msg.sender] > 0 || variableBearerToken[msg.sender] > 0, "Not a depositor");
    _;
}

function getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp(address user) public view onlyDepositor returns (uint256) {
    return fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user].timestamp;
}
```

In this mitigation:

- **`onlyDepositor` modifier**: Restricts function access to users who have made deposits. A depositor is someone who holds either `fixedETHDepositToken` or `variableBearerToken`.
- **Updated function**: The `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp()` function can now only be accessed by depositors, ensuring that attackers cannot query another user’s sensitive data.

---

### Conclusion

#### Summary of Findings:
1. **Lack of Access Control on Sensitive Functions**: Unauthorized users can access sensitive data via the `getFixedOngoingWithdrawalRequestTimestamp()` function. 
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Type**: Access Control
   - **Mitigation**: Introduce an `onlyDepositor` modifier to restrict access to depositors only.

By implementing the suggested access control mechanism, the `LidoVault` contract will be protected against unauthorized access to sensitive information, improving the overall security of the vault system.
