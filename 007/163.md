# LidoVault contract function named getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds exposes sensitive information

### Security Audit Findings Report

**Auditor**: Fat32  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Issue Type**: Access Control Violation  
**Location**: [LidoVault.sol#L154-L156](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L154-L156)

---

### Vulnerability Summary:
The function `getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` exposes sensitive information by allowing any external caller to access ongoing withdrawal request IDs of any user. This allows a malicious actor to enumerate all users’ ongoing withdrawal request information, which may expose sensitive transaction data and open attack vectors.

---

### Impact:
This vulnerability poses an **information disclosure** risk, as any external account can view internal details of another user's vault activity. Specifically, withdrawal request IDs may be exploited for front-running attacks or to gather insights into vault activity that should remain private.

---

### Exploit Scenario:
1. **Attacker's Actions**: 
   - An attacker could call the `getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds()` function and supply another user's address.
   - The attacker retrieves that user's ongoing withdrawal request IDs.
   
2. **Potential Attack Vector**:
   - The attacker can use this information to gather insights into when large withdrawals are happening and potentially initiate front-running transactions or other malicious actions based on the observed withdrawal patterns.

```

The log confirms that an external attacker (`0xbEEF`) was able to call the `getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds` function successfully, revealing private withdrawal request information.

---

### Recommended Mitigation:

To mitigate this issue, access control should be implemented to restrict this function, allowing only the user (or other authorized entities, such as the protocol owner) to retrieve their own ongoing withdrawal request information.

**Solidity Mitigation**:

```solidity
function getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds(address user) public view returns (uint256[] memory) {
    require(msg.sender == user, "Unauthorized: Cannot access another user's withdrawal requests");
    return variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[user];
}
```

This change ensures that only the user who owns the withdrawal request IDs can access this sensitive information.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Issue Type**: Access Control Violation
- **Impact**: Unrestricted access to sensitive user withdrawal information can lead to information leakage and potential attacks.
- **Mitigation**: Restrict access by ensuring only the user can access their own withdrawal request IDs.
