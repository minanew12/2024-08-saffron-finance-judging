# Potential DoS from not having enough stETH to withdraw funds potentially locking funds

### Summary

The `LidoVault.sol` contract sets a minimum deposit amount of 0.01 ETH, allowing users to deposit small amounts into the vault.
The contract interacts with Lido for withdrawals, which has a minimum stETH withdrawal amount of 100 stETH. This is a significant amount compared to the minimum deposit which demonstrates a mismatch between the two requirements and leads to a potential Denial of Service(DoS).

### Root Cause

#### Mismatch in Minimum Values:
* Deposit vs. Withdrawal: If users can deposit as little as 0.01 ETH but need to withdraw at least 100 stETH, it creates a situation where users cannot easily access their funds once deposited.
* Inability to Withdraw: Users who deposit small amounts may find themselves unable to meet the withdrawal threshold, effectively locking their funds in the contract.

### Attack Path

Here's a potential DoS attack path:
#### User Deposits:
* A user deposits the minimum amount of 0.01 ETH into the vault, expecting to be able to withdraw it later.

#### Accumulation of Small Balances:
* Multiple users deposit small amounts, leading to a large number of users with balances significantly below the 100 stETH withdrawal threshold.

#### Inability to Withdraw:
*These users are unable to withdraw their funds because their balances do not meet the minimum withdrawal requirement set by Lido.

#### Locked Funds:
* Users' funds are effectively locked in the contract, as they cannot withdraw their ETH or stETH due to the high minimum withdrawal threshold.

#### Denial of Service:
* Users are denied access to their funds, leading to frustration and potential financial loss. This situation can be considered a DoS attack, as it prevents users from accessing the service they expected.

### Impact

#### Locked Funds:
* Issue: Users who deposit amounts greater than the minimum deposit (e.g., 0.01 ETH) but less than the minimum stETH withdrawal amount (e.g., 100 stETH) may find themselves unable to withdraw their funds.
* Impact: Users' funds are effectively locked in the contract, as they cannot meet the withdrawal threshold to convert stETH back to ETH.

#### Financial Loss:
* Issue: Users may incur financial losses if they cannot access their funds, especially if they need liquidity for other investments or expenses.
* Impact: Inability to withdraw funds can lead to missed opportunities or financial strain for users.

#### Operational Disruption:
* Issue: The contract may face operational challenges if a significant number of users are unable to withdraw their funds.
* Impact: The platform may face increased support requests and operational challenges as users seek to resolve their withdrawal issues. This can strain resources and affect the platform's ability to operate smoothly.


The inability for users to withdraw their funds due to the mismatch between deposit and withdrawal minimums poses a significant risk to user satisfaction, trust, and the platform's overall reputation

### Mitigation

#### Align Minimums
* Ensure that the minimum withdrawal amount is reasonable and aligned with the minimum deposit amount to prevent locking users' funds.
#### Flexible Withdrawals:
* Consider implementing a more flexible withdrawal mechanism that allows users to withdraw smaller amounts, even if it incurs a fee or penalty.
