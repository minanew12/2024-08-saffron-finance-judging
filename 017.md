# Handling ETH Transfers to Smart Contracts Without receive() or fallback() Functions

## Summary
In the current implementation, there are no safeguards to handle scenarios where msg.sender is a smart contract without the capability to receive ETH. If such a smart contract interacts with the contract and the contract tries to send ETH to it, the transaction will fail, resulting in a revert. This failure can interrupt the intended functionality and cause operational issues, particularly in scenarios involving withdrawals or payments.

## Vulnerability Detail
The smart contract does not include explicit checks to determine whether msg.sender is an EOA or a smart contract. Consequently, when the contract attempts to send ETH to an address that is a smart contract without a receive() or fallback() function, the ETH transfer will fail. This is due to the fact that such smart contracts are unable to accept ETH, causing any transaction that involves sending ETH to them to revert.

## Impact
* Transaction Reverts: ETH transfers to smart contracts without receive() or fallback() functions will fail, causing reverts and potentially leaving the contract's state inconsistent.
* Operational Issues: Users who deploy smart contracts without proper ETH handling will experience failed transactions, disrupting the contract's functionality and potentially causing financial losses or inconvenience.
* User Experience: Users interacting with such contracts may face issues without clear explanations, affecting their experience and trust.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a function to check if an address is a smart contract before attempting to transfer ETH. This can help avoid sending ETH to addresses that cannot handle it.

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(account)
    }
    return size > 0;
}
```
