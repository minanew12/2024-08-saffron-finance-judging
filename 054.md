# Usage of native `transfer()` will lock variable user funds

### Summary

The use of `.transfer()` in [L656](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L656) will result in a revert if the recipient is a smart contract. Since this is the only instance where `transfer()` is used, variable side users will not expect this function and will instead anticipate the use of `call()`. This assumption will lead to issues with withdrawing after the vault has started for variable side users. Since `transfer()` only provides 2300 gas for its execution, any smart contract's callback that consumes more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit an event) will cause the transfer to revert.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users on the variable side will not be able to withdraw their funds at will for withdrawals initiated while the vault was active. As a result, their funds will remain locked in the vault.

### PoC

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use `.call()` instead of `.transfer().`
