# Protocol Fee Receiver and Withdrawal Logic Vulnerabilities in LidoVault Contract

## Summary
The LidoVault contract manages deposits, staking via Lido, and the distribution of rewards and early exit fees among fixed and variable users. The contract also collects protocol fees for the protocol fee receiver from variable-side earnings. However, there are issues in the withdrawal logic that create unnecessary restrictions on the protocol fee receiver's ability to withdraw their variable-side deposits and collect accrued fees. These issues may result in blocked withdrawals and inefficiencies in the protocol fee collection process.
(vaultEndedWithdraw function also has get similar problem);

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the withdrawal logic concerning the protocol fee receiver. Specifically, the following issues arise:

**1. Unnecessary Blockage of Protocol Fee Receiver Withdrawals:**
When the protocol fee receiver tries to withdraw their variable-side deposits while the appliedProtocolFee is greater than zero, they are blocked from doing so by this condition in the withdraw function:

if (msg.sender == protocolFeeReceiver && appliedProtocolFee > 0) {
    require(variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0, "WAR");
    return protocolFeeReceiverWithdraw();
}
This check prevents the protocol fee receiver from withdrawing their variable-side deposits even if they have unrelated variable-side withdrawal requests in progress, effectively locking their funds.

**2.Misuse of variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds for Fee Collection:**
The variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds mapping is used to track ongoing withdrawal requests for variable-side users. The contract blocks the protocol fee receiver from collecting protocol fees if they have ongoing withdrawal requests, even though these two processes should be independent.

## Impact
1.Blocked Withdrawals:
The protocol fee receiver might be unable to withdraw their variable-side deposits while there are protocol fees accrued (appliedProtocolFee > 0), locking their funds and causing a disruption in the normal flow of operations.

2.Inefficient Protocol Fee Collection:
By tying protocol fee collection to variable-side withdrawal logic, the contract introduces unnecessary complexity and delays in collecting protocol fees, reducing efficiency.

3.Operational Bottleneck:
The dependency between the protocol fee receiver's own variable-side withdrawal requests and the fee collection process introduces a bottleneck, where one process can block the other, complicating operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**1. Decouple Protocol Fee Collection from Variable Withdrawals:**
The protocol fee receiverâ€™s ability to collect protocol fees should not be tied to their variable-side withdrawal requests. The condition requiring the absence of entries in variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds should be removed to allow the protocol fee receiver to collect protocol fees without interference:

**2. Allow Withdrawal of Variable Deposits by Protocol Fee Receiver:**
The protocol fee receiver should be able to withdraw their variable-side deposits regardless of whether protocol fees have accrued. Remove the restriction that blocks withdrawals when appliedProtocolFee > 0, allowing the protocol fee receiver to operate as a normal variable-side user when withdrawing their own deposits.

**3. Consider Separate Roles for Fee Collection and User Withdrawals:**
To avoid potential conflicts, it may be beneficial to create separate roles or processes for handling protocol fee collection and user withdrawals, ensuring smoother and more efficient operations.
