# Lido FIV Protocol Fee Receiver Can Bypass Variable Side Withdrawal Checks!

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L514


```solidity
else {
  if (msg.sender == protocolFeeReceiver && appliedProtocolFee > 0) {
    require(variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0, "WAR");
    return protocolFeeReceiverWithdraw();
  }
```

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `protocolFeeReceiver` address can also be a variable side depositor. This creates a potential conflict of interest and a way to bypass certain checks. Here's the problematic scenario:

1. The `protocolFeeReceiver` address makes a variable side deposit.
2. This gives them the ability to call the `withdraw` function for the variable side.
3. When they call `withdraw`, the code first checks if they are the `protocolFeeReceiver` and if there's an `appliedProtocolFee`.
4. If these conditions are met, it only checks if `variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0`.
5. It then immediately calls `protocolFeeReceiverWithdraw()` without any further checks.

The vulnerability is that this bypasses all the normal checks and balances for variable side withdrawals. It doesn't check the user's balance, doesn't update any state related to variable side withdrawals, and doesn't handle the withdrawal process in the same way as for other variable side depositors.

This could potentially allow the `protocolFeeReceiver` to:
1. Withdraw more than their fair share of earnings.
2. Withdraw at times when other users can't.
3. Bypass the normal withdrawal process and associated state updates.

To fix this, the contract should either:
1. Prevent the `protocolFeeReceiver` from being a variable side depositor.
2. Or, handle the `protocolFeeReceiver`'s variable side withdrawals separately from their fee withdrawals, ensuring all normal checks and state updates occur for their variable side activity.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of separating roles and ensuring that privileged addresses (like the `protocolFeeReceiver`) don't have unintended additional capabilities that could be exploited.



#### Impact:

The vulnerability allows the protocolFeeReceiver to bypass normal withdrawal checks and potentially drain the contract of more funds than they should be entitled to. This can lead to a loss of funds for other users and compromise the integrity of the entire system.

#### PoC Flow:

1. The protocolFeeReceiver makes a variable side deposit, becoming a variable side user.

2. The vault operates normally, accumulating fees and earnings.

3. At any point (even before the vault ends), the protocolFeeReceiver can call the withdraw function:

   ```solidity
   function withdraw(uint256 side) external {
     // ...
     else if (!isEnded()) {
       if (side == VARIABLE) {
         if (msg.sender == protocolFeeReceiver && appliedProtocolFee > 0) {
           require(variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender].length == 0, "WAR");
           return protocolFeeReceiverWithdraw();
         }
         // ... (normal variable side withdrawal logic)
       }
     }
     // ...
   }
   ```

4. This call bypasses all normal variable side withdrawal checks and immediately calls protocolFeeReceiverWithdraw():

   ```solidity
   function protocolFeeReceiverWithdraw() internal {
     uint256 protocolFee = appliedProtocolFee;
     appliedProtocolFee = 0;
     transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, protocolFee);

     emit VariableFundsWithdrawn(protocolFee, msg.sender, isStarted(), isEnded());
   }
   ```

5. The protocolFeeReceiver can repeat this process multiple times, each time withdrawing the entire appliedProtocolFee, potentially draining the contract.

6. This bypass allows the protocolFeeReceiver to:
   - Withdraw funds before other variable side users
   - Withdraw more than their fair share
   - Avoid updating their withdrawal state (variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds, variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings, etc.)
   - Potentially withdraw both their variable side earnings and protocol fees multiple times

7. The normal accounting and withdrawal request process for variable side users is completely circumvented, leading to inconsistent state and potential fund loss for other users.
