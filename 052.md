# claimFixedPremium Function Allows Claims After Earning Period Has Ended

### Summary

The claimFixedPremium function does not check if the current time is within the valid earning period, allowing users to claim rewards even after the vault's earning period (endTime) has passed. This can lead to potential misuse and incorrect token distribution.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from the lack of a time-bound check within the claimFixedPremium function. Specifically, the function does not verify whether the current block's timestamp is before the endTime, which marks the conclusion of the vault's earning period.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract defines a fixed duration for which users can claim rewards (from startTime to endTime).
startTime and endTime are correctly set when the vault begins.

### External pre-conditions

The user has a positive balance in fixedClaimToken

### Attack Path

A user waits until the earning period has ended (block.timestamp > endTime
The user then calls claimFixedPremium, which does not restrict the call based on the current time.
The user successfully claims a share of the variable side deposits even though the earning period has expired.

### Impact

Users can claim rewards after the intended claim period, potentially leading to undesired token distribution or draining of contract funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add this line of code on claimFixedPremium function
require(block.timestamp <= endTime);
