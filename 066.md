# lack of updates to fix ETHDepositTokenTotalSupply and ETHDepositToken in the withdraw function

### Summary

`fixedETHDepositToken` and `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` are used to track fixed user ETH deposits. These values need to be updated when a fixed user withdraws funds.

### Root Cause

In [LidoVault.sol:496](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L496) there is a missing update of `fixedETHDepositToken` and `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` when Vault started and in progress.

### Impact

- Incorrect values for `fixedETHDepositToken` and `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` during calculation.

### Mitigation

These values should be updated during withdrawals.
