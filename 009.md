# Unfair share distribution

### Summary

In the `deposit` function ([`LidoVault:328`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L328-L391)), the share distribution is unfair. The share is equivalent to the stEth deposit, but it does not count the yield generated by the user that deposit before.

### Root Cause

In [`LidoVault:359`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L359), shares are allocated to the user, with the amount being directly proportional to the stETH deposited.

Consider two users, A and B. User A deposits an amount `A` into the LidoVault several weeks before user B.

User A’s deposit has already generated a yield, `yieldA`. When user B deposits the same amount `A` into the vault, they receive an equal number of shares as user A. However, user B should receive fewer shares because their deposit represents a smaller portion of the vault's total assets, given the yield already accrued by user A’s earlier deposit.

### Attack Path

1. A user call the deposit function
2. A second user call the deposit function a bit after. The longer it is after, the less fair it is.

### Impact

The stETH depositor will be rewarded less than they should be. Moreover, users are then encouraged to wait the last moment to deposit.

### Mitigation

I recommend to compute shares by this way:

```solidity
newShares = shares/stakingBalance()
```
Note that we can add decimals to this to increase precision.
