# No Check for Valid Protocol Fee Receiver

## Summary
The factory allows the protocol fee receiver to be changed via `setProtocolFeeReceiver()` without any validation. Setting the protocol fee receiver to an invalid or zero address could lead to funds being locked in the contract.
```Solidity
  function setProtocolFeeReceiver(address _protocolFeeReceiver) external onlyOwner {
    protocolFeeReceiver = _protocolFeeReceiver;
    emit SetProtocolFeeReceiver(protocolFeeReceiver);
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation check to ensure that the protocol fee receiver is not the zero address:
```solidity
function setProtocolFeeReceiver(address _protocolFeeReceiver) external onlyOwner {
    require(_protocolFeeReceiver != address(0), "Invalid address");
    protocolFeeReceiver = _protocolFeeReceiver;
    emit SetProtocolFeeReceiver(protocolFeeReceiver);
}
```
