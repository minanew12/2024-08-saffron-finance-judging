# Potential Race Condition in `deposit` Function

## Summary
The `fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply` and `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` state variables are intended to be initialized only once when the vault reaches its capacity. However, if multiple users deposit at the same time, race conditions may lead to these variables being incorrectly set multiple times.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the vault reaches its capacity, the deposit function is triggered, and both `fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply` and `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` are set. If multiple deposits are made concurrently, it’s possible for the state variables to be updated multiple times before the vault state is finalized, leading to incorrect or unexpected values.

## Impact
Incorrect values for `fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply` and `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` could affect the calculation of fixed user premiums, potentially leading to unfair distributions or incorrect payouts.
This could also impact the overall dynamics of the vault, as the incorrect values might influence the contract's behavior and calculations.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
To prevent this race condition, consider implementing a mutex or a state check that ensures the state variables are only set once, for example:

Add a `boolean` flag that indicates whether the vault has started. Set this flag when the vault reaches capacity and check this flag before modifying the state variables.
Reorganize the deposit logic to ensure that variable initialization occurs before any state changes that could affect subsequent transactions.
By ensuring that `fixedIntialTokenTotalSupply` and `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` are only set once, you can protect the integrity of the vault's state and maintain accurate tracking of deposits and user entitlements. Additionally, this will reinforce the vault’s operational logic by preventing inconsistencies that could arise from concurrent deposit attempts.
