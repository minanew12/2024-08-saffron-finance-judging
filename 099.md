# vault won't start due to capacities restriction

### Summary

The deposit restriction of fixed side and variable side must be equal to their respective capacities in `LidoVault.sol` may cause the vault never starts

### Root Cause

in `LidoVault.sol:381` The vault only starts when the total deposits of the fixed side and variable side are exactly equal to their respective capacities.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Vault May Not Start: Users are unaware of remaining capacity, they might attempt to deposit amounts exceeding the remaining capacity which leading to transaction failure. If no user deposits the exact amount of the remaining capacity, the vault will remain unstarted indefinitely, users' funds are locked, they cannot earn returns or be withdrawn. Users get poor user experience and funds  remain idle for a long time.

### PoC

### Mitigation

1. Add functions to query the remaining capacity
2. Allow deposits exceeding capacity and refund the excess
3. Modify the vault's start conditions to avoid strict capacity requirements
