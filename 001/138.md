# Variable Side Interest Calculation Inaccuracy in Ended Vaults

## Details

Saffron protocol allows users to deposit ETH into vaults. These vaults have a fixed side, offering a fixed yield, and a variable side, offering a variable yield based on Lido staking rewards.

The LidoVault contract manages these deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculations. When a vault ends, the vaultEndedWithdraw function calculates the proportional share of earnings for variable-side depositors. However, this calculation currently doesn't accurately account for the protocol fees already deducted from the withdrawnStakingEarnings when determining the total earnings to be distributed.

The current implementation could lead to a slight overestimation of the total earnings distributable to variable-side depositors in a vault that has ended. This is because the totalEarnings calculation in the vaultEndedWithdraw function subtracts the totalProtocolFee from the sum of withdrawnStakingEarnings and vaultEndedStakingEarnings, but the withdrawnStakingEarnings have already had the protocol fee deducted during the active phase of the vault.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L709

```solidity
function vaultEndedWithdraw(uint256 side) internal {
    // ... (other code) ...
    uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;
    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```

## Impact

Although the discrepancy might be small, it represents an accounting inaccuracy that could erode trust in the protocol over time. Variable-side depositors may receive slightly less than their entitled share of the earnings, particularly if there were substantial withdrawals during the active vault phase, leading to a higher accumulated totalProtocolFee.

## Scenario

- A vault with a significant variableSideCapacity ends.
- During the active phase of the vault, there were numerous variable-side withdrawals, leading to a relatively large totalProtocolFee.
- When a remaining variable-side depositor attempts to withdraw their share after the vault ends, the totalEarnings calculation doesn't fully account for the deducted protocol fees from the withdrawnStakingEarnings, resulting in a slight overestimation of their share.

## Fix

Adjust the totalEarnings calculation within the vaultEndedWithdraw function to avoid double-counting the protocol fee deduction:

```solidity
// Updated vaultEndedWithdraw function in LidoVault.sol
function vaultEndedWithdraw(uint256 side) internal {
    // ... (other code) ...

    // Calculate totalEarnings considering already deducted protocol fees
    uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;

    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```

By removing - totalProtocolFee from the totalEarnings calculation, we ensure that the protocol fees are not subtracted twice.
