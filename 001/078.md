# Variable users aren't able to withdraw the early exit fees if all the deposited amount was withdrawn before the vault end

### Summary

When the vault starts, FIXED users can withdraw their FIXED stake from Lido, but in return, they have to pay an early exit fee, as compensation for the VARIABLE users that withdraw instead of the profit of the FIXED stake.
>Users from the variable side receive this earlyExitFee as compensation for a reduced rate of income due to the diminished capital deployed to the underlying asset, in this case, Lido Liquid Staking protocol.

When users withdraw their FIXED stake, both Lido balance and shares will decrease. In case all FIXED users withdraw their deposits, and the vault ends, when VARIABLE users try to withdraw the early exit fees paid by FIXED users the TX will revert. This is because `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw` gets called and sets both `vaultEndingStakesAmount` and `vaultEndingETHBalance` as zeros, remember all FIXED deposit is withdrawn. Later, when calculating the `totalEarnings`, the protocol will be divided by `vaultEndingStakesAmount` (which was set to 0 beforehand), reverting with division by 0 error.

This blocks VARIABLE users from withdrawing the `earlyExitFee` that acts as a compensation, forcing them to lose funds.

### Root Cause

The protocol doesn't check if the `vaultEndingStakesAmount` is zero (all FIXED staked amount was withdrawn) before going ahead with the calculation, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L775).

### Impact

DOS, variable users won't be able to withdraw the early exit fees paid by the fixed users.

### PoC

Add the following test in `lido-fiv/test/1.LidoVault.test.ts`:

```typescript
it("BUG - DOS, variable user can't withdraw fees after vault is ended", async () => {
  const { lidoVault, addr1, addr2, addr4 } = await loadFixture(deployLidoVaultFixture)
  await setupMockLidoContracts(lidoVault)

  // Users deposit FIXED and VARIABLE
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).deposit(SIDE.FIXED, { value: parseEther('1000') })
  await lidoVault.connect(addr2).deposit(SIDE.VARIABLE, { value: parseEther('15') })
  await lidoVault.connect(addr4).deposit(SIDE.VARIABLE, { value: parseEther('15') })

  // Vault has started
  expect(await lidoVault.isStarted()).to.equal(true)

  // User 1 claims FIXED premium
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).claimFixedPremium()

  // Half time passes
  const { duration, endTime } = await getTimeState(lidoVault)
  await time.increaseTo(endTime - duration / BigInt(2))

  // User 1 withdraws all their FIXED deposit
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).withdraw(SIDE.FIXED)
  // Withdrawal is finalized
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals()

  // User 1 paid early exit fee, that should be claimed by the VARIABLE users
  expect(await lidoVault.feeEarnings()).to.be.greaterThan(0)

  // End time passes
  await time.increaseTo(endTime + BIG_INT_ONE)

  // Vault is ended
  expect(await lidoVault.isEnded()).to.equal(true)

  // User 2 tries to withdraw the fees, revert with panic
  await expect(lidoVault.connect(addr2).withdraw(SIDE.VARIABLE)).to.be.revertedWithPanic(
    '0x12' // reverted with panic code 0x12 (Division or modulo division by zero)
  )
})
```

### Mitigation

In `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw`, when calculating both `totalEarnings` and `stakingEarningsShare`, check if `vaultEndingStakesAmount` is different than 0 before doing so, by adding something like:
```solidity
function vaultEndedWithdraw(uint256 side) internal {
  ...
  
  if (side == FIXED) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...

    if (vaultEndingStakesAmount != 0) {
      uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;

      if (totalEarnings > 0) {
        (uint256 currentState, uint256 stakingEarningsShare) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
          totalEarnings,
          variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(vaultEndingETHBalance, vaultEndingStakesAmount)
        );
        stakingShareAmount = stakingEarningsShare;
        variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] = currentState.mulDiv(vaultEndingStakesAmount,vaultEndingETHBalance);
        variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[msg.sender] = currentState;
      }
    }

    ...
  }
}
```
