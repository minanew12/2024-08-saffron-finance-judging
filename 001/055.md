# The shares equivalent of amount entitled to the protocolFeeReceiver is included in the common variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] and withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes

## Summary
*There's a problem in the `withdraw` when acting on a variable-side depositor behalf.*

It's not accurate to include the *shares equivalent of the `protocolFee` amount that the `protocolFeeReceiver` is **entitled to*** neither in `variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender]` nor in `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes` when in-progress (`isStarted() == true`) withdrawing on the ***VARIABLE*** side.

## Vulnerability Detail
That is because roughly *5%* of the `ethAmountOwed` (a variable representing the Lido earnings that the variable-side depositor is entitled to) is **entitled** to the `protocolFeeReceiver`.

## Impact
In reality for the calculations for the *variable-side depositor* **vault-is-started-and-is-not-ended** withdrawal flow to be accurate, the `protocolFee` should not only be deducted from the `ethAmountOwed` in general, but also from the shares calculation.

It is evident because all the state-keeping changes applied **do deduct (exclude)** the `protocolFee` from the `ethAmountOwed`, such as in:
`variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[msg.sender] += ethAmountOwed - protocolFee;`
and
`withdrawnStakingEarnings += ethAmountOwed - protocolFee;`.

There will be an imbalance between the assets quantity tracked and the shares quantity tracked, because the shares we apply in `variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] += stakesAmountOwed;` and `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes += stakesAmountOwed;` are based on the ***full amount of the `ethAmountOwed`***, not the `ethAmountOwed - protocolFee`.

Namely the problem happens because in reality the shares caculation `uint256 stakesAmountOwed = lido.getSharesByPooledEth(ethAmountOwed);` should be based on the `ethAmountOwed - protocolFee`, not the **full pre-protocol-fee-distribution initial amount**.

```solidity
          if (ethAmountOwed >= minStETHWithdrawalAmount()) {
            // estimate protocol fee and update total - will actually be applied on withdraw finalization
            uint256 protocolFee = ethAmountOwed.mulDiv(protocolFeeBps, 10000);
            totalProtocolFee += protocolFee;
            uint256 stakesAmountOwed = lido.getSharesByPooledEth(ethAmountOwed); // HERE the amount passed (ethAmountOwed) should be ethAmountOwed - protocolFee

            withdrawnStakingEarnings += ethAmountOwed - protocolFee;
            withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes += stakesAmountOwed;

            variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[msg.sender] += ethAmountOwed - protocolFee;
            variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] += stakesAmountOwed;
            variableToWithdrawnProtocolFee[msg.sender] += protocolFee;
            variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender] = requestWithdrawViaETH(
              msg.sender,
              ethAmountOwed
            );

              emit LidoWithdrawalRequested(
                msg.sender,
                variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender],
                VARIABLE,
                true,
                false
              );
            }
```

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L530-L553

You can also see that the `protocolFee` is ***correctly excluded from what the withdrawer (ex.-depositor) receives as ETH after the stEth withdrawal is fulfilled by Lido's withdrawal queue system***:
```solidity
  /// @notice Finalize a variable withdrawal that was requested after the vault has started
  function finalizeVaultOngoingVariableWithdrawals() external {
    uint256[] memory requestIds = variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];
    if(variableToPendingWithdrawalAmount[msg.sender] != 0) {
      withdrawAmountVariablePending(); // is it re-entrant?
      if(requestIds.length == 0) {
        return;
      }

    }

    require(requestIds.length != 0, "WNR");

    delete variableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender];

    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds);


    uint256 protocolFee = applyProtocolFee(amountWithdrawn);

    uint256 sendAmount = amountWithdrawn + calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare() - protocolFee;

    bool _isEnded = isEnded();
    transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);

    emit LidoWithdrawalFinalized(msg.sender, requestIds, VARIABLE, true, _isEnded);
    emit VariableFundsWithdrawn(sendAmount, msg.sender, true, _isEnded);
  }
```

#### So it's clearly not correct to include the proportion of `protocolFee`'s shares in the `` calculation. That issue consequently makes the following calculation inaccurate.

Both:
```soidity
(lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits),
```
and
```solidity
variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)
```
in
```
(uint256 currentState, uint256 ethAmountOwed) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
              (lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits),
              variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)
            );
```

And correspondingly the other calculations too:
```solidity
  /// @notice Helper function to calculate the ongoing variable withdraw state for user
  /// The vault must track a variable user's withdrawals during the duration of the vault since withdrawals can be executed at any time
  /// @param totalEarnings Amount of staking or fee earnings
  /// @param previousWithdrawnAmount The total amount of earnings already withdrawn
  /// @param user for whom the calculation
  /// @return (currentState, amountOwed) The new total amount of earnings withdrawn, the amount to withdraw
  function calculateVariableWithdrawStateWithUser(
    uint256 totalEarnings,
    uint256 previousWithdrawnAmount,
    address user
  ) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {

    uint256 bearerBalance = variableBearerToken[user];
    require(bearerBalance > 0, "NBT");

    uint256 totalOwed = bearerBalance.mulDiv(totalEarnings, variableSideCapacity);
    uint256 ethAmountOwed = 0;
    if (previousWithdrawnAmount < totalOwed) {
      ethAmountOwed = totalOwed - previousWithdrawnAmount;
    }

    return (ethAmountOwed + previousWithdrawnAmount, ethAmountOwed);
  }
```


There's an inaccuracy particularly at this line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L534

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
HERE the amount passed (`ethAmountOwed`) should be `ethAmountOwed - protocolFee`:
```diff
-           uint256 stakesAmountOwed = lido.getSharesByPooledEth(ethAmountOwed);
+           uint256 stakesAmountOwed = lido.getSharesByPooledEth(ethAmountOwed - protocolFee);
```
