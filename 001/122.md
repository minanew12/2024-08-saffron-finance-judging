# `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()` does not work under certain conditions

## Summary
- `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()` does not work under certain conditions
## Vulnerability Detail
- `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()` does not work as fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply doesn't get updated.
- Let's understand this issue through an example
         - In this example let's suppose Fixed capacity = 1000 ETH and Variable capacity = 30 ETH
         - UserA comes and deposits 500 ETH , UserB deposits 500 ETH in fixed side.
         - UserC deposits 30 ETH in variable side.
         - Vault gets started after above deposits.
         - Now after sometime UserA withdraws his 500 ETH and claims his 500 ETH.
         - After the above step UserB now calls getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance() which calculates 
            user's ongoing variable withdraw state.
         -  But this call would always fail due to this condition `require(lidoStETHBalance > fixedETHDeposits, "LBL");`
         - In this scenario fixedETHDeposits would be 1000 ETH and lidoStETHBalance would nearly equal to 500 -505 Ether as 
            UserA has withdrawn his ETH but the fixedETHDeposits variable doesn't get updated.
         - So during the calculation fixedETHDeposits uses un-updated value due to which it will always revert.



## Impact
- User would not able to calculate ongoing variable withdraw state due to use of un-updated value.
- This value might be used in frontend to show ongoing variable withdraw state but due to faulty behaviour of function , the protocol team would not be able to show that.
