# Incorrect calculation in `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance` function

## Summary

`getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance` function is using wrong variable for `fixedETHDeposits` which leads to incorrect calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail

`getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance` function is implemented for variable users who wants to know how much yield is accrued for them from staking balance. So that variable users can know their earnings from staking balance at present.

For calculating variable users yield `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance` function gets total earnings generated from staking in LIDO. For that they get current staking balance in `lidoStETHBalance` variable and fixed eth deposit in `fixedETHDeposits` variable and then deducting them to get earnings.

```solidity
function getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 lidoStETHBalance = stakingBalance();
    uint256 fixedETHDeposits = fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply;
    require(lidoStETHBalance > fixedETHDeposits, "LBL");
    uint256 totalEarnings = (lidoStETHBalance - fixedETHDeposits) + withdrawnStakingEarnings + totalProtocolFee;
    ...
  }
```

The problem occurs because they get `fixedETHDeposits` from variable called `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply`. Because this variable is tracking fixed deposits till vault starts. If any fixed deposit user withdraw his eth after vault has started then it will be not deducted in `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` variable which leads to incorrect calculation.

```solidity
function getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    ...
@>  uint256 fixedETHDeposits = fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply;
    ...
  }
```

Vulnerability Flow:

- Soppose vault has started with 1000 eth fixed side capacity and 30 eth variable side capacity (values taken from test file values).
- Now if any fixed side user withdraw his 500 eth deposits from the vault before vault has ended.
- After that if varible user wants to know his yield from staking balance so he will call `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance` function.
- But `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` variable is not updated and will give 1000 eth balance.
- And current staking eth balance will be (500 + yield on 500) because half fixed deposit is withdrawn.
- So that it will revert because of lidoStETHBalance > fixedETHDeposits [(500+yield) - 1000].
- Also, if fixed deposit withdraw is small then yield of remaining then it will give wrong value of earnings.

## Impact

Variable user cannot get correct amount to withdraw from staking earnings.

## Recommendation

Use updated values for `fixedETHDeposits` to calculate total earnings.
