# Calls To `vaultEndedWithdraw()` Can Revert Through Underflow Preventing Finalization

### Summary

Some outcomes of the `LidoVault` can lead to a `totalEarnings` calculation that results in `revert` during variable side withdrawal.

This prevents a full term variable side from ever realizing their earnings in accrued fees.

### Root Cause

The following [`totalEarnings` calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L775), executed in calls to [`vaultEndedWithdraw(uint256)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L709C12-L709C44) is liable to integer underflow:

```solidity
uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;

if (totalEarnings > 0) {
    // ...
```

Although we safely handle the case where `totalEarnings` may not evaluate to zero, we do not handle the edge case where `totalProtocolFee`s are in excess of the `vaultEndingETHBalance` (i.e. through slashing).

Notice then, that for the case where `vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount)` is less than the `totalProtocalFee`, this calculation will revert through underflow, i.e.:

```solidity
uint256 a = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount);
uint256 b = totalProtocolFee;
uint256 totalEarnings = b - a + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;  /// @audit a > b will revert
```

For the case where `a` is greater than `b`, this calculation will revert, preventing successful completion of the `vaultEndedWithdraw(uint256)`.

Although the vault may be finalized by a fixed side participant, no variable side accounts will be able to [progress far enough to successfully redeem their share of the fee shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L787C7-L797C1).

### Attack Path

1. A `LidoVault` `isEnded()` with a value of `vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount)` which is less than the `totalProtocalFee`.

### Impact

Inability for all variable side withdrawals to finalize the vault and [claim their share of fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L787C7-L797C1) due to DoS.

### Mitigation

Sanity check the calculation before attempting the subtraction:

```diff
- uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;
+  uint256 shareOfEndingBalance = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount) + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;
+  uint256 totalEarnings = shareOfEndingBalance > totalProtocolFee
+    ? shareOfEndingBalance - totalProtocolFee
+    : 0;
```
