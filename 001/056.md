# in LidoVault line 527 fixedETHDeposits will not always have a correct value

### Summary

in LidoVault line 527  the function **calculateVariableWithdrawState**  is used  to calculate  the earning amount and it takes two arguments one  **totalEarnings**  and **previousWithdrawnAmount**  and based on that it calculates the amount that will be withdrawn   and the problem applies  when calculating **totalEarnings**  it uses   `lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits` and the problem  is in **fixedETHDeposits**  because   **fixedETHDeposits** is  **fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity**  and   in line  499 we can see that if the deposit type  is **Fixed** it subtracts the withdrawal amount from     **fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity** but we can't note that  in order to clime from lido we need to call the function **finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals** so lets say a user requested a Fixed type  withdrawal but doesn't call     **finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals**  so **stakingBalance** will remain the same  but **fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity** will  be updated   so in line 528 when calculating the **totalEarninig** it will count the subtracted or the requested withdrawal amount  from the previous as a profit   

### Root Cause

in LidoVault line 527 it uses fixedETHDeposits //fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity but if **finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals** is not called it will not be correct amount
