# withdraw() has Inconsistent protocol fee accounting between vault ongoing and vault ends

## Summary
`withdraw()` has Inconsistent protocol fee accounting between vault ongoing and vault ends. `withdraw()` will calculate incorrect post-protocol fee earnings for variable-side users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Before vault ends, when a variable-side user requests a withdrawal of earnings, the post fee earning is:  `(proportional_totalEarnings - previousWithdrawnAmount) * (1 - protocolFeeBps)`. Note in this case both `(proportional_totalEarnings` and `previousWithdrawnAmount` are pre-fee values. 
```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 side) external {
...
          (uint256 currentState, uint256 ethAmountOwed) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
            (lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits),
            variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)
          );
...
```



After vault ends, when a variable-side user requests a withdrawal of earnings, the protocol fee is simply applied on proportional totalEarnings. The post fee earning is: `(proportional_totalEarnings - totalProtocolFee - previousWithdrawnAmount)` . Note that in this case `proportional_totalEarnings - totalProtocolFee` is a  post-fee value, but `previousWithdrawnAmount` is still pre-fee values.  

```solidity
  function vaultEndedWithdraw(uint256 side) internal {
...
       //@audit After vault ends, totalEarnings is a post-fee value, but variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] is always pre-fee value. Inconsistent with withdraw before vault ends.
|>      uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;
        (uint256 currentState, uint256 stakingEarningsShare) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
          totalEarnings,
          variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(vaultEndingETHBalance, vaultEndingStakesAmount)
        );

```

Since `previousWithdrawnAmount` is always pre-fee values, the earnings shouldn't include fees. And fees should be deducted afterwards.


## Impact
When vault ends, `withdraw()` will calculate incorrect post-protocol fee earnings for variable-side users.

## Recommendation
In `vaultEndedWithdraw()`, use pre-fee values for `totalEarnings`.
