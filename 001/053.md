# wrong equation when calculating the  profit

### Summary

in  LidoVault function withdraw  line 528  the function **calculateVariableWithdrawState** takes two argument  **totalEarnings** and  **previousWithdrawnAmount**  and based  on that and the user **variableBearerToken** it calculates the amount  of earning and the  problem is  that when calculating  **totalEarnings**  it uses  `(lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes)` where  lidoStETHBalance is the StETH amount of the contract  **currentStakes** is the  ldo share of the contract  and **withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes** is the previous requested amount of shares  and it adds  **currentStakes**  and   **withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes**  but instead it should subtract in order to not count the  previous withdrawal   as a  profit   but  in here it is adding which will even add more  profit       

### Root Cause

in LidoVault.sol:528 it adds   currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes instead it should subtract
