# user who request withdraw before vault start  balance is still accounted in the vault .

## Summary
if the user whos withdraw request was set before the vault started and withdrawn after vault start will increase ``fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity`` .
## Vulnerability Detail
If the user request withdraw before vault start    which increases the fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity and that fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity is used for calculating withdraw amount .
if the user has deposited a large amount of deposit and request before the vault starts then the user who withdraw will be calculated with that large staking balance which could  lead to wrong price being withdrawn 

In Withdraw function the fixedETHDeposits is used ,  
```Solidity
             uint256 fixedETHDeposits = fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity;
      
        uint256 withdrawAmount = fixedETHDeposits.mulDiv(fixedBearerToken[msg.sender], fixedLidoSharesTotalSupply());
        uint256 lidoStETHBalance = stakingBalance();

        if (fixedETHDeposits > lidoStETHBalance) {
     
          // our staking balance if less than our  stETH deposits at the start of the vault - only return a proportional amount of the balance to the fixed user
          withdrawAmount = lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(fixedBearerToken[msg.sender], fixedLidoSharesTotalSupply());
        }
```
## Impact
incorrect accounting
