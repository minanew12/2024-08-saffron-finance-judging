# ETH Locked in Vault Due to Rounding Errors in Fee Distribution

## Summary
The LidoVault contract manages deposits, staking through Lido, and distributes rewards and early exit fees between variable and fixed users. When fixed users withdraw before the vault ends, they are charged early exit fees, which are then distributed to variable users and the protocol fee receiver. However, due to the lack of floating-point arithmetic in Solidity, rounding errors in fee calculations cause small amounts of ETH to be left behind in the contract, permanently locking those funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises in the calculateVariableWithdrawState and calculateVariableWithdrawStateWithUser functions, where the following calculation is used to distribute early exit fees:
uint256 totalOwed = bearerBalance.mulDiv(totalEarnings, variableSideCapacity);

Here, Solidityâ€™s integer division causes the remainder from the division (bearerBalance * totalEarnings % variableSideCapacity) to be discarded. This means small fractions of ETH are not distributed to any user but remain in the contract.

Over time, as more transactions occur, these undistributed remainders accumulate, leading to permanently locked ETH in the vault. Because the fees are already moved from Lido to the vault, these remainders remain in the vault with no mechanism to recover them.

## Impact
This vulnerability leads to small but gradually increasing amounts of ETH being locked in the contract, potentially reducing the overall ETH distributed to users. The longer the contract operates, the larger this locked ETH becomes, representing a loss for users and potentially affecting the correct distribution of rewards and fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent ETH from being locked in the vault due to rounding errors, consider leaving early exit fees in Lido instead of transferring them to the vault. Since the Lido contract manages most of the vault's assets, keeping the early exit fees in Lido would allow the fees to accrue and be distributed without suffering from rounding errors in the vault's internal calculations.

Alternatively, consider implementing a mechanism to recover and redistribute the small remainder amounts that are currently left behind due to Solidity's integer division. This could involve a periodic sweep or redistribution of remaining ETH to active users.
