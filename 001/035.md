# Variable Fee Earnings Share Calculation Overvalues Variable Side Withdrawal's Claim To Fees

### Summary

When performing a variable side withdraw, the withdrawer's claim to the [`feeShareAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L787C7-L797C1) is amplified through mistaking the effect of charging the `protocolFee` as debt owed to the caller.

### Root Cause

When a variable side withdrawal is executed, [their staking earnings are computed as follows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L536C13-L540C88):

```solidity
withdrawnStakingEarnings += ethAmountOwed - protocolFee; /// @audit earnings inclusive of fees
withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes += stakesAmountOwed; /// @audit earnings in shares not inclusive of fees

variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[msg.sender] += ethAmountOwed - protocolFee; /// @audit earnings inclusive of fees
variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] += stakesAmountOwed; /// @audit earnings in shares not inclusive of fees
```

This in itself is not a problem, because the `variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings` is designed to track the specific accounting for a user's withdrawal (subject to protocol fees), whereas the `variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares` is designed to represent the user's total claim to shares at the point the withdrawal was made.

Their total claim to shares (non-inclusive of fees) is used to determine the `msg.sender`'s total share of the accumulated fees at vault finalization.

To describe this concept, notice that in `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance(uint256)`, [a staker's `previousWithdrawnAmount` is amplified](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L885C5-L885C118) to undo the effects of the protocol fee and ensure the calculation is performed in fixed terms of their total shares of the vault at withdrawal: 

```solidity
/// @audit Amplify to undo the effects of the protocol fee so we
/// @audit can reliably relate the `variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings`
/// @audit to as a function of the user's total share of the vault.
uint256 previousWithdrawnAmount = variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[user].mulDiv(10000, 10000 - protocolFeeBps);
```

Now, notice that to calculate the `msg.sender`'s `feeShareAmount`, we make a subsequent call [`calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L787C7-L790C8):

```solidity
uint256 feeShareAmount = 0;
if (withdrawnFeeEarnings + feeEarnings > 0) {
    feeShareAmount = calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare();
}
```

Diving into the function, we see the following:

```solidity
function calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare() internal returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 currentState, uint256 feeEarningsShare) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
      feeEarnings + withdrawnFeeEarnings, /// @audit Calculating the total fees accrued across all shares.
@>    variableToWithdrawnFees[msg.sender] /// @audit Using the value inclusive of fees.
    );

    variableToWithdrawnFees[msg.sender] = currentState;
    withdrawnFeeEarnings += feeEarningsShare;
    feeEarnings -= feeEarningsShare;

    return feeEarningsShare;
}
```

Therefore, the protocol uses a value of `variableToWithdrawnFees[msg.sender]` which decreases the `previousWithdrawnAmount` in calls to [`calculateVariableWithdrawState`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L859C12-L859C42), since **this is the value inclusive of fees**:

```solidity
function calculateVariableWithdrawState(
    uint256 totalEarnings,
    uint256 previousWithdrawnAmount /// @audit Using a lower value since fees were taken from this amount.
) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {

    uint256 bearerBalance = variableBearerToken[msg.sender];
    require(bearerBalance > 0, "NBT");

    uint256 totalOwed = bearerBalance.mulDiv(totalEarnings, variableSideCapacity);
    uint256 ethAmountOwed = 0;
    if (previousWithdrawnAmount < totalOwed) {
      /// @audit Increases  perceived `ethAmountOut` since fees make it 
      /// @audit look like the `msg.sender` has withdrawn less, but these
      /// @audit were actually fees:
      ethAmountOwed = totalOwed - previousWithdrawnAmount;
    }

    return (ethAmountOwed + previousWithdrawnAmount, ethAmountOwed);
}
```

In doing so, the `LidoVault` believes the claimant to have a greater claim to the vault, when in actuality these additional claims are representative of protocol fees.

### Mitigation

Amplify the `previousWithdrawAmount` by undoing the affects of fees when we [`calculateVariableFeeEarningsShare`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L946C12-L946C45):

```diff
(uint256 currentState, uint256 feeEarningsShare) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
      feeEarnings + withdrawnFeeEarnings,
-     variableToWithdrawnFees[msg.sender]
+     variableToWithdrawnFees[msg.sender].mulDiv(10000, 10000 - protocolFeeBps)
);
```
