# Inconsistent Handling of Fixed Side Withdrawals in Ended Vaults

## Details

The Lido Vault contract allows users to deposit ETH and participate in Lido staking with both fixed and variable return options. Fixed-side withdrawals are handled differently when the vault ends, especially in loss scenarios where the final ETH balance is lower than the initial fixed-side deposits.

The `vaultEndedWithdraw` function calculates the amount (`sendAmount`) to be returned to fixed-side depositors based on `vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds`. This value is supposed to reflect the portion of the final balance allocated to fixed users. 

However, when the vault ends with losses (`vaultEndingETHBalance` < `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity`), `vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds` is set to `vaultEndingETHBalance`. This can result in:

- Overestimation: In cases of minor losses, fixed-side users might receive more than their fair share.
- Potential Loss: In scenarios with significant losses, the calculation may not accurately reflect the reduced share, potentially leading to discrepancies and losses.

## Code Snippets

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L675

- **Vault Ending Calculation** (finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals function):

```solidity
if (amountWithdrawn > fixedETHDeposit) {
    vaultEndedStakingEarnings = amountWithdrawn - fixedETHDeposit;
    vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds = fixedETHDeposit;
} else {
    vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds = amountWithdrawn;
}
```

- **Fixed Side Withdrawal** (vaultEndedWithdraw function):

```solidity
sendAmount = fixedBearerToken[msg.sender].mulDiv(
    vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds,
    fixedLidoSharesTotalSupply()
);
```

## Impact

This inconsistency can lead to inaccurate distribution of remaining funds to fixed-side depositors, potentially overestimating their share in loss scenarios and causing discrepancies or even losses.

## Scenario

1. A vault starts with `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` of 1 ETH.
2. The vault ends with `vaultEndingETHBalance` of 0.8 ETH (a loss).
3. A fixed-side depositor tries to withdraw.
4. The code calculates their share based on `vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds` (0.8 ETH), potentially overestimating their entitlement and not accounting for the loss.

## Fix

Add a check in `vaultEndedWithdraw` to ensure the calculated `sendAmount` doesn't exceed the proportional share of the actual `vaultEndingETHBalance`:

```solidity
uint256 maxSendAmount = fixedBearerToken[msg.sender].mulDiv(
    vaultEndingETHBalance, 
    fixedLidoSharesTotalSupply()
);
sendAmount = Math.min(sendAmount, maxSendAmount); 
```
