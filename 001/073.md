# `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw` doesn't take into consideration income withdrawals before slashing, blocking variable users from withdrwing their income

### Summary

When FIXED users deposit ETH, they are being deposited in Lido, and Lido might experience slashing. This is expected on the protocol's side, as the impact would be lower income, but it is expected for the protocol to keep functioning as expected, from the contest README:
>These incidents will decrease income from deposits to the Lido Liquid Staking protocol and could decrease the stETH balance. The contract must be operational after it, but it is acceptable for users to lose part of their income/deposit...

However, this isn't always preserved, let's take the following scenario. We have some FIXED value staked in Lido, some profit is accumulated, VARIABLE user withdraws his cut of that profit, by calling `LidoVault::withdraw`. When doing so, `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes` gets updated to reflect the amount of withdrawn profit shares, but, this value is calculated after some profit. No more profit comes in, and the vault ends, as soon as it ends, before any withdrawals, the vault gets slashed with some amount.
Now, when variable users come to withdraw their profit (slashing didn't remove the whole profit), `totalEarnings` will be calculated wrongly, as the following:
```solidity
uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;
```
As the used `vaultEndingETHBalance` and `vaultEndingStakesAmount` represent the amounts after slashing, while `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes` represents the withdrawn shares before slashing.

This results in wrong `totalEarnings` that also result in wrong `stakingEarningsShare` value for the VARIABLES users, `stakingEarningsShare` will be greater than the contract's balance, forcing funds to be stuck forever, as `transferWithdrawnFunds` will revert.

### Root Cause

When calculating the total earned ETH in `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw`, the protocol doesn't take into consideration the slashing that happened after the vault ended, especially when some VARIABLE users withdrew part of their profit while the vault was still ongoing. `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes` will be a misleading value from the previous profit before being slashed.

### Impact

DOS, variable users can't withdraw their income from the FIXED amount staked.

### PoC

Add the following test in `lido-fiv/test/1.LidoVault.test.ts`:

```typescript
it("BUG - DOS, can't withdraw after Slashing", async () => {
  const { lidoVault, addr1, addr2, addr3 } = await loadFixture(deployLidoVaultFixture)
  const { lidoMock } = await setupMockLidoContracts(lidoVault)

  // Users deposit FIXED and VARIABLE
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).deposit(SIDE.FIXED, { value: parseEther('1000') })
  await lidoVault.connect(addr2).deposit(SIDE.VARIABLE, { value: parseEther('15') })
  await lidoVault.connect(addr3).deposit(SIDE.VARIABLE, { value: parseEther('15') })

  // Vault has started
  expect(await lidoVault.isStarted()).to.equal(true)

  // User 1 claims FIXED premium
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).claimFixedPremium()

  // Half time passes
  const { duration, endTime } = await getTimeState(lidoVault)
  await time.increaseTo(endTime - duration / BigInt(2))

  // Lido rebasing, vault earns 100 ETH
  await lidoMock.addStakingEarningsForTargetETH(
    parseEther('1100'),
    await lidoVault.getAddress()
  )

  // User 2 withdraws their income (part of the above rebasing)
  await lidoVault.connect(addr2).withdraw(SIDE.VARIABLE)

  // Withdrawal was sent to Lido
  expect(
    (await lidoVault.getVariableToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds(addr2.address)).length
  ).to.equal(1)
  // `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes` is now > 0
  expect(await lidoVault.withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes()).to.be.greaterThan(0)

  // End time passes
  await time.increaseTo(endTime + BIG_INT_ONE)

  // Vault is ended
  expect(await lidoVault.isEnded()).to.equal(true)

  // Lido slashes the vault
  await lidoMock.subtractStakingEarnings(parseEther('50'))

  // User 1 withdraws their FIXED deposit
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).withdraw(SIDE.FIXED)
  await lidoVault.connect(addr1).finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals(SIDE.FIXED)

  // User 3 can't withdraw his income
  await expect(
    lidoVault.connect(addr3).finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals(SIDE.VARIABLE)
  ).to.be.revertedWith('ETF')
})
```

### Mitigation

In `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw`, when calculating the `totalEarnings` when a variable user is withdrawing, consider the income that was withdrawn before Lido slashing happens. Maybe have something like the following?
```solidity
totalEarnings = Math.min(totalEarnings, vaultEndingETHBalance);
```
