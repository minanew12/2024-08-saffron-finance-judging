# wrong calculation of `totalOwed ` for the variable Users in `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()`

## Summary
In `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()` , `fixedETHDeposits` takes value from  `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` instead of `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity` resulting into wrong calculation of `totalOwed ` for the variable Users

## Vulnerability Detail

`getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()` is a helper function that returns the withdrawAMount that a variable user can withdraw from vault at any time within the vault duration.


But the `fixedETHDeposits` used to calculate the withdrawAmount is taken as  `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply`.But the `fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` is a fixed value reflecting the amount of total eth deposited by fixed users till the vault starts and doesnt convey how much `stEth` deposited by the fixed Users is remaining in the Lido Vault.



## Impact
wrong calculation of `totalOwed ` for the variable Users in `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()`.
