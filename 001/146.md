# Incorrect earning calculation while vault is in active

### Summary

When the variable depositors withdraw their earnings, the protocol calculates the `totalEarnings` and `previousWithdrawnAmount` using shares and the stETH balance. However, the calculation is incorrect because it multiplies the current stETH balance per stake by the previous withdrawn stakes. As a result, the variable depositors receive incorrect earnings, and the fixed depositors may receive a smaller amount.

### Root Cause

There is an incorrect calculation of the `totalEarnings` and `previousWithdrawnAmount` parameters in the `calculateVariableWithdrawState` function within the [`LidoVault.withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L527) function.

```solidity
        (uint256 currentState, uint256 ethAmountOwed) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
            (lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits),
            variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)
        );
```

If the stETH balance per stake differs from the previous balance per stake, the `totalEarnings` is calculated incorrectly because it uses `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes`. Additionally, `previousWithdrawnAmount` is calculated incorrectly because the previous withdrawn shares are multiplied by the current balance per stake.

```solidity
totalEarnings = lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits
previousWithdrawnAmount = variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)
```

There is also an incorrect calculation of the `totalEarnings` and `previousWithdrawnAmount` parameters in the `calculateVariableWithdrawState` function within the [`LidoVault.vaultEndedWithdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L775-L780) function.

```solidity
      uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;

      if (totalEarnings > 0) {
        (uint256 currentState, uint256 stakingEarningsShare) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
          totalEarnings,
          variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(vaultEndingETHBalance, vaultEndingStakesAmount)
        );
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is a vault and Alice and Bob are variable side depositors and they deposits same ETH.
2. The vault is started with the following initial values.
    - `fixedSideCapacity`: 1000 wei (use wei instead of ETH for the simplicity)
    - `variableSideCapacity`: 30 wei
    - `fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity`: 1000 wei
    - `fixedClaimTokenTotalSupply`: 1000
    - `protocolFeeBps`: 0 (for the simplicity)
3. At time `start < t1 < end`, lido gets 100 wei profit.
4. At time `start < t2 < end`, lido also gets 100 wei profit.

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- At time `t1`, the `lidoStETHBalance` is 1100 wei after gaining a profit of 100 wei, and Alice calls the `withdraw` function.

```solidity
currentStakes = 1000
fixedETHDeposits = 1000
totalEarnings = lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits = 1100 - 1000 = 100.
previousWithdrawnAmount = 0
totalOwed = bearerBalance.mulDiv(totalEarnings, variableSideCapacity) = 100 / 2 = 50
ethAmountOwed = 50 - 0 = 50.
stakesAmountOwed = lido.getSharesByPooledEth(ethAmountOwed) = 50 * 1000 / 1100 = 45
withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes = 45
variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[`Alice`] = 50
variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[`Alice`] = 45
lidoStETHBalance = 1050
```

- At time `t2`, the `lidoStETHBalance` is 1250 wei after gaining a profit of 200 wei, and Bob calls the `withdraw` function.

```solidity
currentStakes = 1000 - 45 = 955
totalEarnings = lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits = 1250 * 1000 / 955 - 1000 = 308
previousWithdrawnAmount = 0
totalOwed = bearerBalance.mulDiv(totalEarnings, variableSideCapacity) = 308 / 2 = 154
ethAmountOwed = 154 - 0 = 154
stakesAmountOwed = lido.getSharesByPooledEth(ethAmountOwed) = 154 * 955 / 1250 = 117
withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes = 45 + 117 = 162
variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[`Bob`] = 154
variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[`Bob`] = 117
lidoStETHBalance = 1250 - 154 = 1096
```

Total earnings is 300 and Alice and Bob should receive same earnings because they deposits the same ethers.
However, Bob receives 154 instead of 150 and this is unfair for Alice.

### Impact

The variable user may receive unfair earnings.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The variable depositors should not be allowed to withdraw earnings before the vault ended.
