# Having exactly 0 steth when withdrawing via will DoS variable users withdrawing

### Summary

When the vault has ended, [LidoVault::withdraw(](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L423)) calls [LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L709), which checkpoints the stakes and eth balance. If they are 0 and the user is withdrawing a variable deposit, it will underflow in the `totalEarnings` calculation when subtracting the `totalProtocolFee`. As users do not get their withdraw right away, they can not allocate it and lose yield because of this, showing its time sensitiveness

### Root Cause

In `LidoVault:775`, there is an unhandled underflow or divison by 0.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User withdraws but there are exactly 0 steth in the contract due to everyone having requested withdrawals.

### Impact

DoSed withdrawals until someone sends some steth to the protocol so it does not revert. This will lead to yield loss for the variable users which goes against the explicit design of the LidoVault which calculates precisely the return variable users should get.

### PoC

In `LidoVault::vaultEndedWithdraw()`, the total earnings are calculated as `uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;`, which underflows if `withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes` is null or `vaultEndingStakesAmount` is 0.

### Mitigation

If the stakes or the balance are 0, skip collecting earnings as there are no earnings to collect: however, there may be pending `feeEarnings` to collect.
