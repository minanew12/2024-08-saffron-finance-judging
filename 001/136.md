# An incorrect income distribution will lead to fund losses during slashing

### Summary

A variable user can withdraw their income before the Saffron Lido Vault concludes. However, total income may decrease due to slashing, allowing variable users to withdraw despite this reduction. Consequently, some users who delay their withdrawals may find that insufficient ethers remain in the vault to cover their funds.

### Root Cause

In LidoVault.sol:775, the calculation of `totalEarnings` is incorrect, particularly during slashing events, which could lead to potential fund losses for users.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L775-L785
```solidity
775:  uint256 totalEarnings = vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) - totalProtocolFee  + vaultEndedStakingEarnings;

777:  if (totalEarnings > 0) {
        (uint256 currentState, uint256 stakingEarningsShare) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
          totalEarnings,
          variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(vaultEndingETHBalance, vaultEndingStakesAmount)
        );
        stakingShareAmount = stakingEarningsShare;
        variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender] = currentState.mulDiv(vaultEndingStakesAmount,vaultEndingETHBalance);
        variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[msg.sender] = currentState;
      }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L673-L680
```solidity
    uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, vaultEndedWithdrawalRequestIds);
    uint256 fixedETHDeposit = fixedSidestETHOnStartCapacity;
    if (amountWithdrawn > fixedETHDeposit) {
      vaultEndedStakingEarnings = amountWithdrawn - fixedETHDeposit;
      vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds = fixedETHDeposit;
    } else {
      vaultEndedFixedDepositsFunds = amountWithdrawn;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

There is a vault with the following parameters. 
fixedSideCapacity : 100 ETH
variableSideCapacity : 3 ETH

### External pre-conditions

Slashing occurs in the Lido Protocol.

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 100 ETH.(a fixed user)
2. Bob deposits 2 ETH and Charlie deposits 1 ETH.(variable users)
3. The stETH balance of vault increases to 103 ETH.
4. Bob withdraw his income (103 - 100) * 2 / 3 = 2 ETH. (For simplicity, we assume no protocol fee) 
5. The vault ends when the stETH balance of vault increases to from 101 ETH to 99 ETH.
6. In LidoVault.sol:775, 
    `vaultEndedStakingEarnings` is 0, because 99 < 101 (See LidoVault.sol:L673-L680).
    totalProtocolFee = 0.
    vaultEndingETHBalance.mulDiv(withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes,vaultEndingStakesAmount) is about 2 ETH.
   So, `totalEarnings` is about 2ETH. 
7. Charlie can withdraw income of about 1ETH.
8. Alice should withdraw 99ETH.

As a result of the above scenario, at least one of Alice and Charlie cannot withdraw their fund because there is no enough ether.

### Impact

1. Some fixed user may not return back his principal.
2. Some variable user may not receive his income.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Variable users should not be allowed to withdraw their income before the end. Or income distribution mechanism should be improved.
