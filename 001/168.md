# Incorrect calculation for `previousWithdrawnAmount` in withdraw() for variable Users while Vault is ongoing

## Summary
While calculating the share of yield for the Variable user when they call `withdraw()` while the Vault is ongoing , the calculation ends up in incorrect value since the `previousWithdrawnAmount` by that user is incorrectly calculated before passing to `calculateVariableWithdrawState()`.

Also the correct implementaion for calculating ethAmountOwed is implented in a seperate function `getCalculateVariableWithdrawStateWithStakingBalance()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L526-L529)
```solidity
          (uint256 currentState, uint256 ethAmountOwed) = calculateVariableWithdrawState(
            (lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(currentStakes + withdrawnStakingEarningsInStakes, currentStakes) - fixedETHDeposits),
            variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)
          );
```
Here the `previousWithdrawnAmount` is calculated as `variableToWithdrawnStakingEarningsInShares[msg.sender].mulDiv(lidoStETHBalance, currentStakes)` but the actual value withdrawn by the user should be calculated as 
```solidity
    uint256 previousWithdrawnAmount = variableToWithdrawnStakingEarnings[user].mulDiv(10000, 10000 - protocolFeeBps);
```    

The first one shows incorrect amount since the share Price in Lido can change from what it was when the user withdrawn initially.


## Impact
Incorrect calculation of `previousWithdrawnAmount` and variable users are grieved therefore.
