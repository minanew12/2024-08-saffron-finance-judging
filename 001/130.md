# Fixed-side depositors face potential losses due to unclear withdrawal amounts and early exit fees

### Summary

Fixed-side depositors can withdraw their staked ETH at any time. They are required to pay an early exit fee if they withdraw before the vault has ended. In some cases, the early exit fee can exceed the withdrawn amount, resulting in depositors receiving nothing. However, as the early exit fee decreases over time, there is a possibility for fixed-side depositors to receive some Ether.

In the current implementation, fixed-side depositors cannot know the exact amount of their withdrawal and the early exit fee, leaving them unaware of the final amount they will receive. This situation is unfair to fixed side depositors. The `withdraw` function should include a parameter that represents the desired amount of Ether the depositors wish to withdraw. Additionally, it should check if the final amount is greater than this specified parameter to protect fixed-side depositors.


### Root Cause

When a fixed-side depositor intends to withdraw their staked Ether after the vault has started but before it ends, he calls the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L423) function.

It calculates the withdraw amount at `L493` and send withdrawal request to the `Lido` at `L500`.

```solidity
File: lido-fiv\contracts\LidoVault.sol
472:     } else if (!isEnded()) { // @audit-info vault started, not ended
473:       if (side == FIXED) {
             [...]
488:         uint256 withdrawAmount = fixedETHDeposits.mulDiv(fixedBearerToken[msg.sender], fixedLidoSharesTotalSupply());
489:         uint256 lidoStETHBalance = stakingBalance();
490: 
491:         if (fixedETHDeposits > lidoStETHBalance) { 
492:           // our staking balance if less than our  stETH deposits at the start of the vault - only return a proportional amount of the balance to the fixed user
493:           withdrawAmount = lidoStETHBalance.mulDiv(fixedBearerToken[msg.sender], fixedLidoSharesTotalSupply());
494:         }
             [...]
499:         fixedToVaultOngoingWithdrawalRequestIds[msg.sender] = WithdrawalRequest({ 
500:           requestIds: requestWithdrawViaETH(msg.sender, withdrawAmount),
501:           timestamp: block.timestamp
502:         });
             [...]
512:         return;
```
To finalize the withdrawal process, the depositor should call the [finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L595) function.
Here, it calculates the amount to send from the [claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L812) function and sends `Ether` to `msg.sender`.

```solidity
File: lido-fiv\contracts\LidoVault.sol
595:   function finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals() external { 
596:     uint256 sendAmount = claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(msg.sender);
         [...]
604:     transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);
607:   }
```
In the [claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L812) function, it first claims `ETH` from Lido. Then, it calculates an early exit fee and returns the final amount that fixed depositors can receive at `L842`. If an early exit fee is larger than the withdrawal amount, it becomes `0`.
```solidity
File: lido-fiv\contracts\LidoVault.sol
812:   function claimFixedVaultOngoingWithdrawal(address user) internal returns (uint256) { 
         [...]
831:     uint256 amountWithdrawn = claimWithdrawals(msg.sender, requestIds); 
832: 
833:     uint256 earlyExitFees = calculateFixedEarlyExitFees(upfrontPremium, request.timestamp);
834:     // make sure, that earlyExitFee cant be higher than initial deposit
835:     earlyExitFees = Math.min(earlyExitFees, amountWithdrawn); 
         ...
842:     return amountWithdrawn - earlyExitFees; // @audit-info this can be zero
```

When the depositor calls the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L423) function, he can't know the amount of early exit fee and the final amount he can receive. And there is no way to revert the withdrawal action.
No depositor wants to withdraw `0` Ether with consuming gas fee.

However, as the early exit fee decreases over time, there is a possibility for fixed-side depositors to receive some `Ether` if he withdraws later.
As shown above, it is unfair for the fixed side depositors.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A fixed side depositor is going to withdraw their `ETH` before the vault ends.

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposited some `ETH` to the vault.
2. Alice withdraw their `ETH` right after the vault starts.

Due to early exit fees, Alice can't receive anything.

### Impact

Fixed side depositors could receive nothing due to early exit fees. As the early exit fee decreases over time, there is a possibility for fixed-side depositors to receive some `Ether`. This is unfair for fixed side depositors who want to withdraw their `ETH`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add a parameter that represents the desired withdrawal amount and to check if the final amount is greater than this specified value.
