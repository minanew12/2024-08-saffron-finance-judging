# `LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH` Results In Excessive DoS

## Summary

Using a constant [`LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L1018C27-L1018C51) value increases the protocol's susceptibility to DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LidoVault` imposes the constraint that the shortfall experienced when minting shares must not exceed an empircally evaluated [`LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/38dd9c8436db341c331f1b14545770c1766fc0ee/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L1018C27-L1018C51):

```solidity
/// @notice ETH diff tolerance either for the expected deposit or withdraw from Lido - some rounding errors of a few wei seem to occur
uint256 public constant LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH = 10 wei;
```

```solidity
// Stake on Lido
/// returns stETH, and returns amount of Lido shares issued for the staked ETH
uint256 stETHBalanceBefore = stakingBalance();
uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
require(shares > 0, "ISS");
// stETH transfered from Lido != ETH deposited to Lido - some rounding error
uint256 stETHReceived = (stakingBalance() - stETHBalanceBefore);

/// @audit Do not allow more than `10 wei` shortfall:
@> require((stETHReceived >= amount) || (amount - stETHReceived <= LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH), "ULD");
```

However, the same threshold tolerance is imposed regardless of the size of the `amount` staked.

Assuming maximum allowable slippage of `10 wei` for a nominal token, then minting `10` nominal tokens clearly amplifies perceived slippage past the threshold, even though the rate per token would remain within the intended operational limits of the protocol.

## Impact

Reduced availability, especially for larger deposits.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The maximum slippage permitted during deposits should be a function of the nominal `amount`.
