# `deposit()` Will Always Revert Because Slippage Tolerance `LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH` Is Too Low

## Summary

`LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH` is set to `10`, which is too low and will cause the `deposit()` function to always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit` function includes a slippage tolerance check to ensure that the amount of stETH received from Lido is within the expected range. However, the slippage tolerance is set to `10`, which is too low and will always revert the `deposit()` function:

```solidity
    /// @notice ETH diff tolerance either for the expected deposit or withdraw from Lido - some rounding errors of a few wei seem to occur
->  uint256 public constant LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH = 10 wei;
```

```solidity
      // Stake on Lido
      /// returns stETH, and returns amount of Lido shares issued for the staked ETH
      uint256 stETHBalanceBefore = stakingBalance();
      uint256 shares = lido.submit{value: amount}(address(0)); // _referral address argument is optional use zero address
      require(shares > 0, "ISS");
      // stETH transfered from Lido != ETH deposited to Lido - some rounding error
      uint256 stETHReceived = (stakingBalance() - stETHBalanceBefore);
->    require((stETHReceived >= amount) || (amount - stETHReceived <= LIDO_ERROR_TOLERANCE_ETH), "ULD");
```

As shown in the deployed Lido contract, the exchange rate is not 1:1.
At the time of writing, 1 ETH is equivalent to 0.848033148273146669 stETH: [Lido Contract on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84#readProxyContract#F5)

## Impact

DoS on the `deposit` function.
