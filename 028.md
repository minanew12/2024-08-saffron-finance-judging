# Initialization Access will lead to user funds being comprised

### Summary

The initialize function lacks of access control. It only checks isFactoryCreated value, but doesn't restrict who can call it(msg.sender). This could allow unauthorized entities to reinitialize the contract or alter critical parameters

### Root Cause

In LidoVault.sol:276 lack of checking vault ownership on initialize function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. users have deposited funds
2. attacker calls the initialize function to reinitialize the vault with malicious parameters. He could set earlyExitFeeBps and protocolFeeBps to large values, which effectively draining user funds as they attempt to withdraw
3. attacker can change protocolFeeReceiver to his own address so that protocol fee will be sent to him

### Impact

User Financial Losses:
Users may receive less than what they are entitled to due to manipulated fees. Protocol fees could be sent to an attacker's address.
