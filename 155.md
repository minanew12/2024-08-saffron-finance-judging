# `VaultFactory` despite importing `Ownable2Step` is not inheriting from it thereby leaving the  owner transfership mechanism vulnerable

## Summary

1. `VaultFactory` imports `Ownable2Step` as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/VaultFactory.sol#L6).
2. `VaultFactory` inherits from `Ownable` as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/VaultFactory.sol#L16)
3. This results in the ownership transfer mechanism to rely on `Ownable` instead of much safer `Ownable2Step`.


## Vulnerability Detail

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in OpenZeppelin's `Ownable.sol` where a single-step transfer is implemented. This can be a problem for all methods marked in `onlyOwner` throughout `VaultFactory` contract, some of which are core contract functionality.

## Impact 

High, because important protocol functionality will be bricked

## Likelihood 

Low, because an error or mistake on the admin's end will cause this

## Code Snippet

```diff
-   contract VaultFactory is ILidoVaultInitializer, Ownable {
+   contract VaultFactory is ILidoVaultInitializer, Ownable2Step {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is a best practice to use two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a `pending` state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract. Consider using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable2Step` contract.

See Code Snippet section above for the recommended solution.
