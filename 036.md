# Sandwich attack leading to vault start DoS

## Summary
Two buckets (`fixedETHDepositTokenTotalSupply` and `variableBearerTokenTotalSupply`) are both required to be 100% full for a vault to start. We can manipulate them through a MEV type sandwich attack so that a vault (basically) never starts.

## Vulnerability Detail
- As soon as a vault is created, we fill the variable side to capacity through `deposit()`. The `variableBearerTokenTotalSupply` bucket is full entirely with our 30 ETH.
- Monitor and wait for fixed side to almost get full. When a `deposit()` transaction from fixed side will fill the fixed bucket 100%, and would jumpstart the vault, we frontrun withdraw our entire 30 ETH through `withdraw()`. Their deposit then executes so the fixed bucket is 100% full, but the variable bucket is empty. We then backrun their deposit and `deposit()` 29.99 ETH back into variable bucket.
- We now monitor the variable bucket which has 0.01 ETH left unsatisfied for a vault start, which is exactly one deposit left. When someone deposits that would fill this bucket (and thus both buckets would be full and a vault would start), we frontrun withdraw our 29.99 ETH and backrun a deposit of 29.98 ETH. 
- The variable bucket would now be 29.98 our ETH and 0.01 someone else ETH. This way, the variable bucket will always have 0.01 total remaining and never be full for 3,000+ deposits.
- Anytime someone from variable side wants to withdraw, this just gives us more volume to reclaim. We can deposit whatever amount they withdrew and prolong the attack. People are likely to start withdrawing after they understand the vault is DoS'ed.
- The variable bucket will never be filled (at least for 3,000 deposit attempts from other users), and the vault will not be able to start.

## Impact
Created vaults can get their starting DoS'ed. Note: Does not have to use full 30/30 ETH, this is just for maximum duration of DoS, could be done with 1 ETH 100 times for example (0.01 min withdraw/depo).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Possible remedies
- Blacklist addresses from withdrawing (pre vault start) after they have already withdrawn X amount of times before a vault starts. Requires keeping a counter and associated check during pre-start withdraws.
- Allow `protocolFeeReceiver` or admin to manually jumpstart a vault if it's close to 100% on both sides.
