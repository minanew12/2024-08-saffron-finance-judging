# Transactions calling `LidoVault::finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals` will fail if one of the requests for withdrawals to Lido reverts causing funds being stuck (DoS).

### Summary

When a user calls `LidoVault::finalizeVaultOngoingFixedWithdrawals` all the queued requests are sent individually in a loop to Lido. So a long loop of requests is expected to be processed in this one transaction as shown below.
