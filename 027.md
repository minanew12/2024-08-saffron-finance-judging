# Zero-Amount Withdrawal Attack in finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals()

## Summary
A malicious user could exploit the function by initiating zero-amount withdrawals, causing unnecessary gas consumption and execution overhead.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises in the vaultEndedWithdraw() function when called by finalizeVaultEndedWithdrawals(). Specifically, the function allows a withdrawal request to proceed even if the sendAmount is 0, triggering the transferWithdrawnFunds() function with zero ETH. This leads to an inefficient execution and an opportunity for attackers to perform zero-amount transactions that waste gas.

If fixedBearerToken[msg.sender] is 0, the sendAmount becomes 0. However, the function continues execution and transfers 0 ETH, which consumes gas unnecessarily.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows attackers to perform gas-griefing attacks by repeatedly triggering this function with zero-amount transactions, potentially making the contract costly or slow to use for legitimate users, especially in high-traffic scenarios where many users are trying to withdraw their funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a check to ensure the sendAmount is greater than zero before calling transferWithdrawnFunds() to avoid processing unnecessary zero-amount transactions.
Modify the vaultEndedWithdraw() function to include the following condition:
```solidity
...
if (sendAmount > 0) {
    transferWithdrawnFunds(msg.sender, sendAmount);
}
...
```

Instead of modifying all instances where withdrawals or transfers happen, a better solution is to add a validation in the transferWithdrawnFunds() function itself. This will ensure that no zero-amount transfers occur regardless of where the function is called from.
```solidity
function transferWithdrawnFunds(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(recipient != address(0), "NZA");
    require(amount > 0, "NZA"); //Amount is zero

    (bool sent, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
    require(sent, "ETF");

    emit FundsTransferred(amount, recipient);
}
```
