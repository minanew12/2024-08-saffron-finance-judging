# Ownable is not initialized in `VaultFactory.sol`

## Summary
The "Ownable" that is inherited by openzeppelin is not initialized.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a contract inherits the "Ownable" by openzeppelin the owner should be passed as an argument in the constructor as we see here:
```solidity

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the contract setting the address provided by the deployer as the initial owner.
     */
    constructor(address initialOwner) {
        if (initialOwner == address(0)) {
            revert OwnableInvalidOwner(address(0));
        }
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }
```

However in the "VaultFactory.sol" the `Ownable.sol` is not initialized as we can see in the constructor:
```solidity
constructor(uint256 _protocolFeeBps, uint256 _earlyExitFeeBps) {
    require(_protocolFeeBps < 10_000, "IPB");
    protocolFeeReceiver = msg.sender;
    protocolFeeBps = _protocolFeeBps;
    earlyExitFeeBps = _earlyExitFeeBps;
    vaultContract = address(new LidoVault(true));
    emit VaultCodeSet(msg.sender);
  }
```
## Impact
The owner will not be set leading to 'onlyOwner` modifier not working

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor the constructor
```solidity
constructor(uint256 _protocolFeeBps, uint256 _earlyExitFeeBps) Ownable(msg.sender) {
    // Rest of your initialization
}
```
