# VaultFactory owner uninitialized leaving all `onlyOwner` setters inaccessible

## Summary
`Ownable` constructor is never called during VaultFactory constructor, leaving `onlyOwner` setter functions inaccessible.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an owner is not set during construction from a contract that inherits Ownable, the owner address remains 0x0, meaning any function that uses `onlyOwner` is permanently inaccessible after VaultFactory.sol deployment. 

The owner wants to be able to call the onlyOwner functions to change the associated state values for future vaults created through the factory, but they cannot.

## Impact
Owner cannot call `setProtocolFeeBps`, `setProtocolFeeReceiver`, and `setEarlyExitFeeBps` to change state for future vaults deployed through the factory.

```diff

+  constructor(uint256 _protocolFeeBps, uint256 _earlyExitFeeBps) Ownable(msg.sender) {
