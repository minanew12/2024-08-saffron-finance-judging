# Inadequate Validation in Lido Withdrawal Processing

## Summary
The `_requestWithdraw` and `_claimWithdrawals` functions in the `LidoVault` contract lack sufficient validation checks, which can lead to failed withdrawal requests and unclaimed funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. `_requestWithdraw`
Issue: Insufficient validation of withdrawal amounts.
```solidity
1137:   function _requestWithdraw(address user, uint256 stETHAmount) internal returns (uint256[] memory) {
1138:     unlockReceive = true;
1139:     require(stETHAmount >= MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT, "WM");
---
1142:     bool approved = lido.approve(address(lidoWithdrawalQueue), stETHAmount);
1143:     require(approved, "AF");
---
1145:     uint256[] memory amounts = calculateWithdrawals(stETHAmount);
---
1148:     uint256[] memory requestIds = lidoWithdrawalQueue.requestWithdrawals(amounts, address(this));
1149:     require(requestIds.length > 0, "IWR");
---
1151:     emit WithdrawalRequested(stETHAmount, requestIds, user);
---
1153:     unlockReceive = false;
1154:     return requestIds;
1155:   }
```
The function does not validate if the withdrawal amount exceeds the maximum allowed per request or if the user has sufficient stETH balance. This can lead to failed requests.

2. `_claimWithdrawals`
Issue: Lack of validation to ensure all withdrawal requests are processed correctly.
```solidity
1168:   function _claimWithdrawals(address user, uint256[] memory requestIds) internal returns (uint256) {
1169:     unlockReceive = true;
1170:     uint256 beforeBalance = address(this).balance;
---
1174:     for (uint i = 0; i < requestIds.length; i++) {
1175:       lidoWithdrawalQueue.claimWithdrawal(requestIds[i]);
1176:     }
---
1178:     uint256 withdrawnAmount = address(this).balance - beforeBalance;
1179:     require(withdrawnAmount > 0, "IWA");
---
1181:     emit WithdrawalClaimed(withdrawnAmount, requestIds, user);
---
1183:     unlockReceive = false;
1184:     return withdrawnAmount;
1185:   }
```
The function assumes all requests are successfully processed without validating each claim's success. If a claim fails, it may not be detected, leading to unclaimed funds.

## Impact
Without proper validation, funds may remain unclaimed, causing discrepancies in expected vs. actual balances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_requestWithdraw`
- Validate both minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts.
- Check the user's stETH balance before processing the request to ensure they have sufficient funds.

`_claimWithdrawals`
- Add checks to ensure each withdrawal claim is successful.
- Implement retry mechanisms or logging for failed claims to track and address issues.
