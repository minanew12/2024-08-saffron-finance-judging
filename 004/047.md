# Re-initialization Process isn't clear in Cloned Vaults

## Summary
The `initialize()` function is called after the vault is cloned, but thereâ€™s no built-in protection to prevent it from being called multiple times. If someone calls `initialize()` again on the same vault, it can overwrite its state with new values.
And `contructor()` function is called once, `isFactoryCreated` is always set by `true`.
Thus, `initialize()` function is no necessary in cloned vaults, Initialize process is not clear.
There are several problems arise in the process.
```solidity
constructor(bool _initialize) {
    isFactoryCreated = _initialize;
  }
```


```solidity
 function initialize(InitializationParams memory params) external {
    require(isFactoryCreated != true, "MBF");
    // Only run once by vault factory in atomic operation right after cloning, then fixedSideCapacity is set
    require(fixedSideCapacity == 0, "ORO");

    // Validate args
    require(params.vaultId != 0, "NEI");
    require(params.duration != 0, "NEI");
    require(params.fixedSideCapacity != 0, "NEI");
    require(params.variableSideCapacity != 0, "NEI");
    require(params.earlyExitFeeBps != 0, "NEI");
    require(params.protocolFeeReceiver != address(0), "NEI");

    require(params.fixedSideCapacity.mulDiv(minimumFixedDepositBps, 10_000) >= minimumDepositAmount, "IFC");

    // Initialize contract state variables
    id = params.vaultId;
    duration = params.duration;
    fixedSideCapacity = params.fixedSideCapacity;
    variableSideCapacity = params.variableSideCapacity;
    earlyExitFeeBps = params.earlyExitFeeBps;
    protocolFeeBps = params.protocolFeeBps;
    protocolFeeReceiver = params.protocolFeeReceiver;

    emit VaultInitialized(
      id,
      duration,
      variableSideCapacity,
      fixedSideCapacity,
      earlyExitFeeBps,
      protocolFeeBps,
      protocolFeeReceiver
    );
  }
 ```
```solidity
 function createVault(
    uint256 _fixedSideCapacity,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint256 _variableSideCapacity
  ) public virtual {
    // Deploy vault (Note: this does not run constructor)
    address vaultAddress = Clones.clone(vaultContract);

    require(vaultAddress != address(0), "FTC");

    // Store vault info
    uint256 vaultId = nextVaultId++;
    vaultInfo[vaultId] = VaultInfo({creator: msg.sender, addr: vaultAddress});
    vaultAddrToId[vaultAddress] = vaultId;

    InitializationParams memory params = InitializationParams({
      vaultId: vaultId,
      duration: _duration,
      fixedSideCapacity: _fixedSideCapacity,
      variableSideCapacity: _variableSideCapacity,
      earlyExitFeeBps: earlyExitFeeBps,
      protocolFeeBps: protocolFeeBps,
      protocolFeeReceiver: protocolFeeReceiver
    });

    // Initialize vault
    ILidoVault(vaultAddress).initialize(params);

    emit VaultCreated(
      vaultId,
      _duration,
      _fixedSideCapacity,
      _variableSideCapacity,
      earlyExitFeeBps,
      protocolFeeBps,
      protocolFeeReceiver,
      msg.sender,
      vaultAddress
    );
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an `initialized` boolean flag in the LidoVault contract and ensure that the `initialize()` function can only be called once.
And clear the process of initializing considering several problems during the process.
