# Core vault parameters may be reset at any time by any user for any non-factory created `LidoVault`

## Summary

There is no mechanism which prevents `LidoVault::initialize` from getting called repeatedly by any user for a non-factory created LidoVault, i.e. whose `isFactoryCreated` value is set to `false`.


## Vulnerability Detail

Please refer to the `Code Snippet` section below when referring to line numbers.

See line `@1>`. The condition ` require(isFactoryCreated != true,...` will always be true for any non-factory created LidoVault. As this is always true, this function may be called and executed any number of times. 

Also, there is no access control. So any user may call it.


## Impact

High, as for any such LidoVault contract all the core parameters such as duration , fixedSideCapacity, variableSideCapacity, all fees etc. can be controled or changed by any user.


## Code Snippet

See [LidoVault::initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L277):

```javascript
    function initialize(InitializationParams memory params) external {
@1>     require(isFactoryCreated != true, "MBF");
        ...
        // Initialize contract state variables
        id = params.vaultId;
        duration = params.duration;
        fixedSideCapacity = params.fixedSideCapacity;
        variableSideCapacity = params.variableSideCapacity;
        earlyExitFeeBps = params.earlyExitFeeBps;
        protocolFeeBps = params.protocolFeeBps;
        protocolFeeReceiver = params.protocolFeeReceiver;
        ...
```

## Recommendation

Consider adding access control mechanism and a one-time use lock to prevent re-initialization.
