# Missing Access Control for Initialization

## Vulnerability Detail
The cloned vault's initialize() function can be called by anyone. Although it's immediately initialized by the factory, a potential risk arises if someone else calls it before or after the factory initializes the vault.
```solidity
 function initialize(InitializationParams memory params) external {
    require(isFactoryCreated != true, "MBF");
    // Only run once by vault factory in atomic operation right after cloning, then fixedSideCapacity is set
    require(fixedSideCapacity == 0, "ORO");

    // Validate args
    require(params.vaultId != 0, "NEI");
    require(params.duration != 0, "NEI");
   ....
}
```

## Recommendation
Use access control to restrict who can initialize the vault. Only the `VaultFactory` should be able to call `initialize()`.
