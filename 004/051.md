# Cloning Risk and Uninitialized State Variables, Potential Race Condition with createVault(), No Limitations on Vault Creation

## Summary
- The contract uses the `Clones.clone()` method to deploy new vaults. Since the constructor is not run in the cloned vault, it's important that the `initialize()` function properly sets all necessary variables. Missing or incomplete initialization could leave the vault in an invalid state.
- The factory relies on cloning the vault and then initializing it in two separate steps. In a worst-case scenario, a malicious actor might try to interact with the vault before it is fully initialized, leading to inconsistent behavior or vulnerabilities.
- Anyone can call the `createVault()` function and deploy a new vault. This could lead to spam vault creation and excessive consumption of gas. There is no access control or rate limiting in place to prevent abuse.

  function createVault(
    uint256 _fixedSideCapacity,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint256 _variableSideCapacity
  ) public virtual {
    // Deploy vault (Note: this does not run constructor)
    address vaultAddress = Clones.clone(vaultContract);

    require(vaultAddress != address(0), "FTC");

    // Store vault info
    uint256 vaultId = nextVaultId++;
    vaultInfo[vaultId] = VaultInfo({creator: msg.sender, addr: vaultAddress});
    vaultAddrToId[vaultAddress] = vaultId;

    InitializationParams memory params = InitializationParams({
      vaultId: vaultId,
      duration: _duration,
      fixedSideCapacity: _fixedSideCapacity,
      variableSideCapacity: _variableSideCapacity,
      earlyExitFeeBps: earlyExitFeeBps,
      protocolFeeBps: protocolFeeBps,
      protocolFeeReceiver: protocolFeeReceiver
    });

    // Initialize vault
    ILidoVault(vaultAddress).initialize(params);

    emit VaultCreated(

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Ensure that the `initialize()` function in LidoVault correctly initializes every necessary variable and that default values are handled carefully.
- While Solidity transactions are atomic and would prevent partial execution, itâ€™s always safer to ensure that initialization happens immediately after the vault is cloned. Refactoring this logic within a single function call prevents any gaps between cloning and initialization.
- Implement access control so only authorized users (e.g., owners or whitelisted addresses) can create new vaults.
- Alternatively, you can charge a fee for creating a vault to deter spam vault creation.
