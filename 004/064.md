# Front-running Vulnerability in LidoVault Initialization

### Summary

The lack of access control in the initialize() function of the LidoVault contract will cause a front-running attack for protocol users as an attacker will monitor the blockchain for newly cloned contracts and call the initialize() function with arbitrary parameters before the legitimate initialization by the factory occurs.


### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L276, the initialize() function is publicly accessible and lacks any access control. The OpenZeppelin Clones library creates a proxy of the contract using only the runtime code of the implementation, which means the constructor is not called during cloning. As a result, state variables (like isFactoryCreated) are initialized to their default values (e.g., false for booleans), and any party can call the initialize() function after the contract has been cloned, leading to the vulnerability​(

### Internal pre-conditions


The factory contract calls Clones.clone(vaultContract) to create a new vault. This newly cloned contract has default state values (e.g., isFactoryCreated is false).
The initialize() function of the cloned vault is publicly callable, without any restrictions or access controls.
The initialize() function has no ownership or factory verification, allowing any address to execute it.


### External pre-conditions

An attacker monitors the blockchain or mempool for new vault creation events.
The factory does not immediately initialize the cloned vault in the same transaction in which the clone is created, leaving a time window for the attacker to exploit.
The attacker submits a transaction to call initialize() before the legitimate factory does, gaining control over the vault’s state initialization.


### Attack Path

Factory clones the vault: The VaultFactory contract creates a new instance of the LidoVault by calling Clones.clone(vaultContract). This creates a proxy contract that has the same behavior as the original LidoVault but is uninitialized at the time of creation.

Attacker monitors the blockchain: The attacker, using tools to track contract events or the mempool, detects the cloning of the vault before it has been initialized.

Attacker submits an initialize() call: The attacker quickly submits a transaction to call the public initialize() function with their own parameters. Since the cloned vault’s isFactoryCreated flag is initially false, the call is successful.

Legitimate initialization fails: Once the attacker has initialized the vault, the factory’s subsequent attempt to initialize it will fail due to the check require(isFactoryCreated != true, "MBF");. The attacker’s parameters (such as vaultId, protocolFeeReceiver, etc.) are now locked in, preventing the legitimate use of the vault.


### Impact

Loss of control over vault parameters: The attacker can set arbitrary or malicious values during initialization, such as a high earlyExitFeeBps or setting themselves as the protocolFeeReceiver. This compromises the vault’s intended behavior and economic model.

Lockout from legitimate initialization: Once the vault is initialized by the attacker, the factory or legitimate users can no longer initialize the vault correctly. This leads to a denial of service, rendering the vault unusable for its intended purpose.

Financial losses: Depending on the parameters set, the attacker could redirect protocol fees to their address or make the vault economically unfavorable for legitimate users, causing direct financial loss to the protocol or its users.

        vm.expectRevert("MBF");
        factory.initializeVault(1);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To prevent this front-running vulnerability, the following mitigations are recommended:

Access Control on initialize() Function:
The initialize() function should have restricted access, such that only the VaultFactory contract can call it. This can be achieved by adding an onlyFactory modifier that checks if the caller is the factory.
```solidity
modifier onlyFactory() {
    require(msg.sender == factory, "Caller is not the factory");
    _;
}

function initialize(InitializationParams memory params) external onlyFactory {
    require(isFactoryCreated != true, "Already initialized");
    require(fixedSideCapacity == 0, "ORO");

    // Initialize state variables
    id = params.vaultId;
    duration = params.duration;
    fixedSideCapacity = params.fixedSideCapacity;
    variableSideCapacity = params.variableSideCapacity;
    earlyExitFeeBps = params.earlyExitFeeBps;
    protocolFeeBps = params.protocolFeeBps;
    protocolFeeReceiver = params.protocolFeeReceiver;

    isFactoryCreated = true;
}
```
2 . Immediate Initialization after Cloning
To further mitigate front-running risks, the VaultFactory contract should initialize the vault immediately in the same transaction as the cloning. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to front-run the transaction.

Example in the VaultFactory contract:

```solidity
function createVault(
    uint256 _fixedSideCapacity,
    uint256 _duration,
    uint256 _variableSideCapacity
) public virtual {
    // Clone the vault
    address vaultAddress = Clones.clone(vaultContract);

    // Ensure the vault address is valid
    require(vaultAddress != address(0), "Failed to clone vault");

    // Increment the vault ID and store vault info
    uint256 vaultId = nextVaultId++;
    vaultInfo[vaultId] = VaultInfo({creator: msg.sender, addr: vaultAddress});
    vaultAddrToId[vaultAddress] = vaultId;

    // Prepare initialization parameters
    InitializationParams memory params = InitializationParams({
        vaultId: vaultId,
        duration: _duration,
        fixedSideCapacity: _fixedSideCapacity,
        variableSideCapacity: _variableSideCapacity,
        earlyExitFeeBps: earlyExitFeeBps,
        protocolFeeBps: protocolFeeBps,
        protocolFeeReceiver: protocolFeeReceiver
    });

    // Initialize the vault immediately after cloning
    ILidoVault(vaultAddress).initialize(params);

    // Emit event after vault creation and initialization
    emit VaultCreated(vaultId, _duration, _fixedSideCapacity, _variableSideCapacity, earlyExitFeeBps, protocolFeeBps, protocolFeeReceiver, msg.sender, vaultAddress);
}
```
