# `LidoVault` created by `VaultFactory::createVault` can never be initialized. It also makes all the `VaultFactory` setters useless.

## Summary

`LidoVault` created by `VaultFactory::createVault` can never be initialized. This happens because `isFactoryCreated` is already set to `true` which blocks the `LidoVault::initialize` call.

This also means that all the setters in `VaultFactory` such as `setProtocolFeeBps`, `setProtocolFeeReceiver` and `setEarlyExitFeeBps` are in-effect useless.


## Vulnerability Detail

Please refer to the `Code Snippet` section below when referring to line numbers.

1. See `@1>` line in `VaultFactory::constructor`. Here `VaultFactory::vaultContract` is set to an address of a `LidoVault` contract which is passed a `true` value in its `constructor`.
2. See line `@2>` in `LidoVault::constructor`. Here `isFactoryCreated` is set to whatever value was passed to the constructor.
3. Therefore, `VaultFactory::vaultContract` points to a contract with its `isFactoryCreated` set to `true`.
4. See line `@3>` in `VaultFactory::createVault` which tries to call `LidoVault::initialize` function.
5. See line `@4>` in `LidoVault::initialize` which blocks the initialization call from going through. Here the check `require(isFactoryCreated != true,...` will fail.


## Impact

Impact is High as none of the core parameters can be set. Also, all the setters in `VaultFactory` such as `setProtocolFeeBps`, `setProtocolFeeReceiver` and `setEarlyExitFeeBps` are in-effect useless.

See [VaultFactory::constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/VaultFactory.sol#L86):

```javascript
    constructor(uint256 _protocolFeeBps, uint256 _earlyExitFeeBps) {
        require(_protocolFeeBps < 10_000, "IPB");
        protocolFeeReceiver = msg.sender;
        protocolFeeBps = _protocolFeeBps;
        earlyExitFeeBps = _earlyExitFeeBps;
@1>     vaultContract = address(new LidoVault(true));
        emit VaultCodeSet(msg.sender);
    }

    ) public virtual {
        // Deploy vault (Note: this does not run constructor)
        address vaultAddress = Clones.clone(vaultContract);
        ...

        InitializationParams memory params = InitializationParams({
          vaultId: vaultId,

        // Initialize vault

    }
```


See [LidoVault::initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-saffron-finance/blob/main/lido-fiv/contracts/LidoVault.sol#L277):

@4>     require(isFactoryCreated != true, "MBF");
        ...
        // Initialize contract state variables
        id = params.vaultId;
        duration = params.duration;
        fixedSideCapacity = params.fixedSideCapacity;
        variableSideCapacity = params.variableSideCapacity;

        protocolFeeBps = params.protocolFeeBps;
        protocolFeeReceiver = params.protocolFeeReceiver;
        ...
```


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Remove the `isFactoryCreated` check from `initialize`. Instead create a lock which ensures that the code block may be executed just once similar to `initializer` modifier used by OpenZeppelin's proxy code.
